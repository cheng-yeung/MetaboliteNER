PMC2267737	D00004	The LIPO window carries information particularly on lipoprotein lipids and albumin, whereas the LMWM window contains signals from smaller metabolites such as creatinine and glucose (; ).
PMC2267737	D00030	DKD was associated with elevated triglycerides, lower HDL cholesterol and decreased albumin in the LIPO window.
PMC2267737	D00031	Other studies have also reported the connection between albuminuria and triglycerides (; ; ), but the exact role of HDL metabolism remains unclear.
PMC2267737	D00032	Serum creatinine and urea are two waste products that are normally excreted by the kidneys and, accordingly, the LMWM window revealed elevated values for the macroalbuminuric group, although none of the patients had end-stage renal disease.
PMC2267737	D00035	Our results from the metabonomic analysis were similar: the SOM regions with patients that have a detectable loss in kidney function (i.e., elevated creatinine and urea, decreased serum albumin) overlapped with insulin resistance and related problems in glucose metabolism (dyslipidemia, high insulin dose, high HbA_1c , elevated lactate and acetate and high fasting glucose) (; ; ; ).
PMC2267737	D00036	Interestingly, the neighborhood with the most severe insulin resistance did not coincide with the highest values of creatinine and urea, which suggests that there is a subtle systematic difference between the two clinical conditions.
PMC2267737	D00040	For instance, although lipid treatment was most common in the MetS neighborhood, this group of patients still had the highest triglyceride concentration.
PMC2267737	D00041	This suggests that DKD with lower triglycerides is not a product of lipid-lowering treatment alone.
PMC2267737	D00049	Undoubtedly, triglyceride concentration is the most significant serum biomarker (; ), and its role may be even further emphasized here, as triglycerides produce pronounced _1 H NMR resonances.
PMC2267737	D00053	Low concentration of HDL_2 cholesterol was the common, albeit not exclusive, denominator for all complications, which suggests that HDL_2 has a protective effect, or is a marker of a favorable phenotype with respect to both micro- and macrovascular complications.
PMC2267737	D00055	There is a negative correlation between HDL cholesterol and serum triglycerides, so any linear model that includes both the two is likely to emphasize one at the expense of the other.
PMC2267737	M02005	Data points between 4.2 and 5.0 p.p.m. were omitted and the intensities between 3.22 and 3.88 p.p.m. were given only 0.1% weight in the SOM algorithm to attenuate the effect of glucose.
PMC2267737	M02023	Easily distinguishable peaks in the LMWM window such as urea around 5.68 p.p.m. and acetate at 1.86 p.p.m. were quantified by direct peak integration.
PMC2267737	R00001	A typical _1 H NMR spectrum of human serum is characterized by broad resonances from the lipid molecules of lipoprotein particles, such as the −CH_3 group of triglycerides, cholesterol compounds and phospholipids.
PMC2267737	R00002	This so-called lipoprotein lipids (LIPO) window is a complex mixture of the aforementioned lipid signals, serum albumin and albumin-bound fatty acid resonances across the aliphatic region, and the less intense signals from smaller molecules such as creatinine, lactate and glucose (, ).
PMC2267737	R00014	The LMWM window is dominated by the numerous glucose resonances between 3.1 and 3.9 p.p.m., although some lipid signals still remain.
PMC2267737	R00016	For example, lactate creates a strong doublet signal around 1.28 p.p.m.
PMC2267737	R01018	In , the two creatinine peaks at 2.98 and 3.99 p.p.m. are higher for the DKD region (5,1).
PMC2267737	R04003	Triglyceride concentration is a part of the MetS definition, and the highest unit-specific value (3.6 mmol/l) can therefore be seen at the southwest corner of the map, where also the MetS is most severe.
PMC2267737	R04004	Total serum cholesterol is only partially linked to triglycerides, as it produces an ascending north-south pattern on the SOM.
PMC2267737	R04005	Nevertheless, the highest value (6.0 mmol/l) coincides with that of triglycerides at (1,9).
PMC2267737	R04006	HDL_2 cholesterol exhibits a more complicated pattern, with the highest value (0.64 mmol/l) located near the southeast corner, and the lower values (0.41–0.47 mmol/l) located on the western side.
PMC2267737	R04010	Regression model estimates for (A) serum triglyceride concentration, (B) cholesterol level, (C)
PMC2267737	R04011	HDL_2 cholesterol and (D) serum creatinine.
PMC2267737	R04013	(E) Concentrations of serum urea were obtained by direct peak integration around 5.68 p.p.m.
PMC2267737	R04015	(G) Lactate signal at 4.05 p.p.m.
PMC2267737	R04016	(H) acetate at 1.86 p.p.m.
PMC2267737	R04017	and (I) glucose at 3.44 p.p.m. were quantified by peak integration.
PMC2267737	R04018	Creatinine singlets at 2.98 and 3.99 p.p.m. and urea around 5.68 p.p.m. have a strong association with DKD and produce similar colorings of approximately doubled values on the western side of the SOM as compared with the eastern side.
PMC2267737	R04019	Furthermore, lactate at 1.28 and 4.05 p.p.m. and acetate at 1.86 p.p.m.
PMC2267737	R04021	The effect of the glucose resonances between 3.1 and 3.9 p.p.m. was suppressed when constructing the SOM, but nevertheless the remaining doublet from α-glucose around 5.19 p.p.m. was enough to separate patients who had high blood glucose at the time of sample collection.
PMC2267737	R04022	Although the daily variations are large in type I diabetic patients, high glucose values do partially overlap with the MetS and other complications on the southwestern half.
PMC2267737	R05002	depicts the three most important lipid variables (see also the NMR-derived colorings in ), with highly statistically significant patterns for triglycerides (P =3.1 × 10_−19 ), total cholesterol (P =2.1 × 10_−13 ) and HDL_2 C (P =2.5 × 10_−6 ).
PMC2267737	R05004	The highest concentration of ApoB (117 mg/dl) coincides with the highest triglycerides and cholesterol in the southwest corner at (9,1) and appears to be elevated if either of the two is higher than average (P =1.1
PMC2267737	R05008	(E) Apolipoprotein B-100, (F) HDL_3 cholesterol, (G) insulin dose, (H) glycemic control and (I) 24 h-urine albumin were included instead of those metabolites from that were estimated by _1 H NMR.
PMC2267737	R05009	Creatinine is easily detectable by _1 H NMR as two singlets at 2.98 and 3.99 p.p.m accordingly, the non-NMR measurement in closely matches the NMR-derived creatinine (and biologically correlated urea) in (P =9.2 × 10_−7 ).
PMC2267737	R05012	Corresponding patterns were previously observed for the MetS and NMR-derived lactate, acetate and glucose, which can be seen as an indication of insulin resistance.
PMC2267737	R06002	Biochemically, these groups differ significantly: triglycerides (2.8 versus 0.84 mmol/l), cholesterol (5.8 versus 4.5–4.9 mmol/l), serum creatinine (116 versus 87–88 μmol/l) and 24 h-urine albumin (356 versus 13–16 mg) are high, whereas HDL-subfractions are low in the MetS district.
PMC2267737	R06014	On the other hand, total cholesterol is higher in the southeast (4.9 versus 5.7 mmol/l), so the difference in the ratio of HDL_2 to total cholesterol is less pronounced.
PMC2267737	R06016	Although both districts share relatively high HDL_2 C concentrations, ApoA_1 , ApoB, HDL_3 C and total cholesterol are lower in the northern district.
PMC2267737	R06018	Triglycerides and glycemic control (HbA_1c 8.2%) exhibit no clear differences, as was seen also in the spectral estimates of triglycerides in .
PMC2538910	A00000	Glucose ingestion after an overnight fast triggers an insulin-dependent, homeostatic program that is altered in diabetes.
PMC2538910	A00002	We have developed a mass spectrometry-based strategy to simultaneously measure 191 metabolites following glucose ingestion.
PMC2538910	A00003	In two groups of healthy individuals (n =22 and 25), 18 plasma metabolites changed reproducibly, including bile acids, urea cycle intermediates, and purine degradation products, none of which were previously linked to glucose homeostasis.
PMC2538910	A00006	Multivariate analysis revealed that declines in glycerol and leucine/isoleucine (markers of lipolysis and proteolysis, respectively) jointly provide the strongest predictor of insulin sensitivity.
PMC2538910	A01000	glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity, metabolic profiling
PMC2538910	D00000	In the current study, we have applied metabolic profiling to investigate the kinetics of human plasma biochemicals in response to an oral glucose challenge.
PMC2538910	D00004	One of the most surprising findings of this investigation is the dramatic increase in bile acid levels following glucose ingestion.
PMC2538910	D00009	In the current study, we found that ingesting glucose alone elicits a bile acid response of similar magnitude, which is sustained for 2 h.
PMC2538910	D00010	Our finding is supported by previous work showing that glucose ingestion can increase the plasma concentration of cholecystokinin, a hormone signaling the gallbladder to contract.
PMC2538910	D00012	Given these findings, and our observation of bile acid release following glucose ingestion, we tested the hypothesis that bile acids influence peripheral glucose uptake.
PMC2538910	D00013	We could not detect an effect of bile acids on basal or insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, however, in cultured adipocytes (data not shown).
PMC2538910	D00014	At present, the physiologic role of sustained bile acid release following glucose ingestion is unknown.
PMC2538910	D00015	Although insulin resistance is traditionally defined as the reduced ability of insulin to promote glucose uptake or as the impaired suppression of gluconeogenesis, resistance can emerge in other insulin-dependent processes.
PMC2538910	D00023	Our study demonstrates that an individual's ‘insulin response profile', namely, the vector of sensitivities to insulin action along multiple physiologic axes, can be revealed by metabolite excursions in response to a glucose challenge.
PMC2538910	D00024	Specifically, we have shown that excursions in Leu/Ile and glycerol, reflecting the sensitivity of proteolysis and lipolysis to the action of insulin, are jointly predictive of fasting insulin, with each of the two excursions offering complementary and significant explanatory power.
PMC2538910	D00026	Monitoring the response to glucose ingestion across multiple axes in larger, prospective clinical studies of pre-diabetics could establish links between insulin sensitivity profiles and disease progression, thus helping to predict future diabetes and its complications as well as to guide therapeutic interventions.
PMC2538910	M00001	Control subjects (ingesting water instead of glucose solution) were assigned at random, balancing gender.
PMC2538910	M00002	Metabolic profiling analysis was limited to those subjects with normal fasting glucose concentrations (below 100 mg/100 ml) and normal glucose tolerance (2-h glucose concentration below 140 mg/100 ml).
PMC2538910	M00004	Additional selection criteria for FOS-NGT were normal fasting glucose concentrations and normal glucose tolerance.
PMC2538910	M00005	Additional selection criterion for FOS-IGT was impaired glucose tolerance (2-h glucose concentration between 140 and 199 mg/100 ml).
PMC2538910	M01001	Control subjects (ingesting water instead of glucose solution) were assigned at random, balancing gender.
PMC2538910	M01002	Metabolic profiling analysis was limited to those subjects with normal fasting glucose concentrations (below 100 mg/100 ml) and normal glucose tolerance (2-h glucose concentration below 140 mg/100 ml).
PMC2538910	M02001	Additional selection criteria for FOS-NGT were normal fasting glucose concentrations and normal glucose tolerance.
PMC2538910	M02002	Additional selection criterion for FOS-IGT was impaired glucose tolerance (2-h glucose concentration between 140 and 199 mg/100 ml).
PMC2538910	M03002	Next, each subject ingested a glucose solution (Trutol, 75 g in 296 ml; NERL Diagnostics, East Providence, RI; contains citric acid and sodium benzoate) or an identical volume of bottled water (Poland Spring Water, Wilkes Barre, PA) over a 5-min period.
PMC2538910	M03007	After 12 h overnight fast, subjects ingested 75 g glucose in solution.
PMC2538910	M03008	Blood samples were drawn fasting and 120 min after glucose ingestion.
PMC2538910	M04002	Next, each subject ingested a glucose solution (Trutol, 75 g in 296 ml; NERL Diagnostics, East Providence, RI; contains citric acid and sodium benzoate) or an identical volume of bottled water (Poland Spring Water, Wilkes Barre, PA) over a 5-min period.
PMC2538910	M05001	After 12 h overnight fast, subjects ingested 75 g glucose in solution.
PMC2538910	M05002	Blood samples were drawn fasting and 120 min after glucose ingestion.
PMC2538910	M06004	Plasma samples were thawed gradually, and 165 μl from each sample was mixed with 250 μl of ethanol solution (80% ethanol, 19.9% H_2 O, and 0.1% formic acid) to precipitate out proteins.
PMC2538910	M08000	Plasma samples were thawed gradually, and 165 μl from each sample was mixed with 250 μl of ethanol solution (80% ethanol, 19.9% H_2 O, and 0.1% formic acid) to precipitate out proteins.
PMC2538910	M09000	Plasma glucose concentration was measured with a hexokinase assay (MACS: Quest Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA; FOS: Abbott Laboratories, IL).
PMC2538910	M09002	In MACS, sodium fluoride–potassium oxalate blood tubes were used for glucose analysis, and blood tubes with no additive were used for insulin analysis.
PMC2538910	M10001	The significance of a difference between glucose and water ingestion was calculated using the unpaired Wilcoxon rank sum test.
PMC2538910	M11001	The significance of a difference between glucose and water ingestion was calculated using the unpaired Wilcoxon rank sum test.
PMC2538910	R00000	To systematically characterize the normal biochemical response to glucose ingestion in humans, we obtained plasma samples for metabolic profiling from an ongoing study, Metabolic Abnormalities in College Students (MACS, see Materials and methods).
PMC2538910	R00002	As part of the metabolic assessment, MACS subjects also undergo a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with multiple blood draws.
PMC2538910	R00003	To control for the fasting condition and for the effects of fluid ingestion, a subset of MACS subjects selected at random were given an identical volume of water instead of the glucose solution.
PMC2538910	R00004	Venous blood was drawn during fasting and then every 30 min following glucose or water ingestion for the 2-h duration of the test.
PMC2538910	R00005	We obtained samples from 22 subjects ingesting glucose and 7 control subjects ingesting water.
PMC2538910	R00006	Serum concentrations of glucose and insulin were measured throughout the test.
PMC2538910	R00007	All subjects had normal fasting glucose levels, and all glucose-ingesting subjects showed normal glucose tolerance, as currently defined by the .

PMC2538910	R00023	Subjects ingesting glucose (OGTT).
PMC2538910	R00025	Number of subjects in each glucose tolerance category.
PMC2538910	R00026	IGT, impaired glucose tolerance; NGT, normal glucose tolerance.
PMC2538910	R00030	These 21 significantly altered metabolites span pathways previously studied in the context of glucose homeostasis, as well as some never linked to this program.
PMC2538910	R00033	The 2-h time point has clinical significance, and can aid in the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes.
PMC2538910	R00034	FOS-NGT is a group of individuals with normal glucose tolerance, derived from the Framingham Offspring Study.
PMC2538910	R00035	This group is similar to MACS in size, gender composition, and glucose tolerance, but these individuals are approximately 20 years older and differ in their ancestry.
PMC2538910	R00038	The remaining two metabolites, malate and arginine, fell below our significance threshold.
PMC2538910	R00039	We have thus identified 18 plasma metabolites exhibiting highly reproducible and likely robust responses to glucose ingestion in healthy individuals.
PMC2538910	R00043	Abbreviations: TCDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid; GCDCA, glycochenodeoxycholic acid; GCA, glycocholic acid, Orn: ornithine, Cit: citrulline, β-OH-B: β-hydroxybutyrate.
PMC2538910	R01000	The systematic profiling approach has enabled us to identify a number of plasma metabolites, not previously associated with glucose homeostasis, that change reproducibly in response to an oral glucose challenge.
PMC2538910	R01002	The levels of three bile acids—glycocholic acid, glycochenodeoxycholic acid and taurochenodeoxycholic acid—more than doubled during the first 30 min after glucose ingestion, and remained elevated for the entire 2 h. Water ingestion produced a smaller increase in bile acids, which was not sustained beyond the 30 min time point.
PMC2538910	R01003	All three compounds are primary bile acids conjugated to glycine or taurine.
PMC2538910	R01004	Metabolic responses not previously linked to glucose homeostasis.
PMC2538910	R01007	Abbreviations: TCDCA, taurochenodeoxycholic acid; GCDCA, glycochenodeoxycholic acid; GCA, glycocholic acid.
PMC2538910	R01008	(B) Citrulline and ornithine, urea cycle intermediates.
PMC2538910	R01009	(C) Hypoxanthine, a product of purine nucleotide degradation.
PMC2538910	R01010	The levels of citrulline and ornithine, two non-proteinogenic amino acids that participate in hepatic urea synthesis, decreased by 35 and 29%, respectively during the 2-h test.
PMC2538910	R01011	Gluconeogenesis from amino acids (primarily alanine), which supports 25–40% of the non-glycogen-derived hepatic glucose output after an overnight fast, is coupled to urea synthesis.
PMC2538910	R01012	The decreases in citrulline and ornithine may thus be associated with the reduction in gluconeogenesis and urea synthesis following glucose ingestion.
PMC2538910	R01013	Hypoxanthine, a purine base generated from degradation of adenine and guanine nucleotides, decreased in MACS by 39% within 2 h of glucose ingestion, and this pattern was replicated in FOS-NGT.
PMC2538910	R01014	Xanthine, a purine base generated from hypoxanthine by oxidation, also decreased in both groups (MACS: −9%, P <0.05; FOS-NGT: −41%, P <10_−4 ).
PMC2538910	R01015	The decreases in hypoxanthine and xanthine may be explained by a combination of attenuated release and accelerated uptake.
PMC2538910	R01016	Hypoxanthine taken up by tissues can support nucleotide biosynthesis through the purine salvage pathway (; ) and may also be indicative of a switch from catabolism to anabolism of nucleic acids, analogous to the simultaneous transitions in fat and protein metabolism.
PMC2538910	R01017	Interestingly, hippuric acid increased by over 1000% during the first 30 min and decreased gradually thereafter.
PMC2538910	R01018	Most likely this response is not related to glucose, but rather reflects the presence of the preservative benzoic acid, a precursor of hippuric acid, found in the glucose beverage used for OGTT (see Materials and methods).
PMC2538910	R02000	Much of the biochemical response to glucose ingestion, which we studied in an unbiased way, can be attributed to the broad actions of insulin.
PMC2538910	R02001	Specifically, we have detected an increase in lactate and decreases in glycerol, β-hydroxybutyrate and amino acids.
PMC2538910	R02002	These metabolite changes correspond to the stimulation of glucose metabolism and to the suppression of lipolysis, ketogenesis, and proteolysis (as well as stimulation of amino-acid uptake), all of which are known to be elicited by insulin (; ).
PMC2538910	R02005	(B) The kinetics of glucose and pyruvate derivatives (MACS, mean±s.e.m.).
PMC2538910	R02011	Abbreviations: β-OH-B, β-hydroxybutyrate.
PMC2538910	R02012	Our method captured the temporal relationship between glucose and intermediates of glycolysis.
PMC2538910	R02013	Specifically, the increase in pyruvate, lactate, and alanine occurred between 30 and 60 min, lagging ∼30 min behind the glucose rise, consistent with previous reports.
PMC2538910	R02014	Interestingly, the kinetics of malate, an intermediate in the Krebs cycle, closely resembled the kinetics of lactate and pyruvate, suggesting that a fraction of the pyruvate formed through glycolysis was carboxylated to generate malate through oxaloacetate.
PMC2538910	R02015	To our knowledge, elevation of plasma malate levels due to glucose ingestion has not been previously reported.
PMC2538910	R02017	The levels of glycerol, β-hydroxybutyrate, and multiple amino acids all declined after glucose ingestion, but the kinetic pattern of glycerol and β-hydroxybutyrate was remarkably different from amino acids.
PMC2538910	R02018	Over the 2 h, the decrease in glycerol and β-hydroxybutyrate levels was 57 and 55%, respectively, whereas the drop in amino acids was moderate (between 14 and 36%).
PMC2538910	R02019	The branched-chain amino acids leucine/isoleucine (indistinguishable by our method), for example, decreased by 33%.
PMC2538910	R02020	Interestingly, the time to reach half-maximal decrease in the amino acids (50–72 min) was greater than in β-hydroxybutyrate (42 min) and glycerol (30 min).
PMC2538910	R02021	Moreover, the inter-individual variance in metabolite levels shrunk dramatically over the 2 h in glycerol and β-hydroxybutyrate (84 and 95% reduction of inter-quartile range, respectively), whereas in amino acids the maximal reduction was 53%.
PMC2538910	R03001	Insulin sensitivity is traditionally defined as the ability of insulin to promote the uptake of glucose into peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle and fat or to suppress gluconeogenesis in the liver.
PMC2538910	R03004	Considering that several metabolic processes taking place following glucose ingestion are mediated by insulin, we hypothesized that insulin sensitivity could be reflected not only by changes in glucose but also by the OGTT response of multiple other metabolites.
PMC2538910	R03005	Because our initial studies were focused on normal, healthy individuals spanning a narrow range of fasting insulin levels, we performed a third analysis on a group of individuals with impaired glucose tolerance from the Framingham Offspring Study, FOS-IGT, who spanned a broader range of fasting insulin concentrations.
PMC2538910	R03007	Out of the 18, 6 showed a statistically significant (P <0.05) correlation with fasting insulin, and included the excursions in lactate, β-hydroxybutyrate, amino acids (leucine/isoleucine, valine, and methionine), and a bile acid (GCDCA).
PMC2538910	R03008	Taken together with the glycerol excursion, which scored (P =0.07) slightly below the significance threshold, the response of four distinct insulin action markers correlated with fasting insulin.
PMC2538910	R03010	Notably, the glucose excursion was not correlated with fasting insulin (P =0.20).
PMC2538910	R03011	These findings suggest that resistance to the action of insulin on the metabolism of glucose, fat, and protein is reflected by the metabolite response to OGTT.

PMC2538910	R03022	A bivariate model consisting of the 2-h changes in leucine/isoleucine and in glycerol.
PMC2538910	R03026	The top regression model identified consisted of the excursions in Leu/Ile and glycerol (R _2 _adj =0.54, P =0.0001).
PMC2538910	R03027	In this bivariate model, the independent contribution from each metabolite excursion was significant (Leu/Ile: P =8 × 10_−5 , glycerol: P =4 × 10_−3 ), and the two predictors were not correlated with each other (P =0.6).
PMC2538910	R03030	Notably, the explanatory power of the Leu/Ile and glycerol excursions was significant even after controlling for BMI (P =2 × 10_−3 and 3 × 10_−3 , respectively).
PMC2538910	R03031	A graphical representation of the Leu/Ile–glycerol model demonstrates that some individuals with high fasting insulin exhibit a blunted decline in glycerol, whereas others exhibit a blunted decline in Leu/Ile.
PMC2538910	R03036	Interestingly, the Leu/Ile excursion had the largest coefficient in the first component, whereas the glycerol excursion contributed primarily to the second.
PMC2538910	R03037	The prediction error of the bivariate model consisting of the excursions in Leu/Ile and glycerol was lower than the PLS model error.
PMC2538910	R03038	These findings indicate that the excursions in Leu/Ile and glycerol are sufficient to capture the correlation of 2-h metabolite changes with fasting insulin.
PMC2538910	R03040	Remarkably, all three methods spotlighted the change in Leu/Ile and change in glycerol as being predictive of fasting insulin.
PMC2647729	D00011	The relatively high level of glucose and low level of lactate is strikingly different to observations in other types of cancer where, commonly, lactate levels are high.
PMC2647729	D00012	It is unlikely that the high level of glucose can be ascribed to any other disorder because none of the patients was diagnosed with any other medical condition leading to elevated glucose.
PMC2647729	D00013	It is possible that the levels of glucose may be linked to the unique behavior of oral cancer, which interferes with the ability of insulin to modulate the uptake of glucose and thus regulates consequent energy metabolism favoring the accumulation of carbohydrates and the process of ketogenesis.
PMC2647729	D00014	Several potential precursors of glucose in gluconeogenesis, such as lactate, alanine, and other gluconeogenic amino acids, were found at lower concentrations in patients with head and neck cancer.
PMC2647729	D00016	The increased level of ketone bodies can be linked to lipolysis as a backup mechanism for energy production.
PMC2647729	D00022	Furthermore, several Krebs cycle intermediates such as citrate, succinate, and formate were less concentrated in patients with disease suggesting a suppressed Krebs cycle.
PMC2647729	D00024	Elevated levels of 2-hydroxybutyrate may be associated with protein and amino acid catabolism.
PMC2647729	D00026	For example, ornithine and asparagine levels were higher in oral cancer patients than in control samples.
PMC2647729	D00028	Ornithine represents a metabolite found in the urea cycle, which can use amino acid breakdown products to feed into the Krebs cycle.

PMC2647729	D00030	A significant decrease in blood plasma threonine and glycine has previously been reported at the early stage of head and neck cancer but has been attributed to dysphagia and consequent insufficient food intake rather than to the disease itself.

PMC2721977	A00000	Go to: Borate is an antibacterial preservative widely used in clinical and large scale epidemiological studies involving urine sample analysis.
PMC2721977	A00001	Since it readily forms covalent adducts and reversible complexes with hydroxyl and carboxylate groups, the effects of borate preservation in _1 H NMR spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling of human urine samples have been assessed.
PMC2721977	A00002	Effects of various concentrations of borate (range 0–30 mM) on _1 H NMR spectra of urine were observed at sequential time points over a 12 month period.
PMC2721977	A00003	Consistent with known borate chemistry, the principal alterations in the _1 H resonance metabolite patterns were observed for compounds such as mannitol, citrate and α-hydroxyisobutyrate and confirmed by ESI-MS analysis.
PMC2721977	A00006	Addition of borate caused a general decrease in _1 H values consistent with non-specific effects such as solution viscosity changes.
PMC2721977	A00008	From a molecular phenotyping and epidemiologic viewpoint, typical interpersonal biological variation was shown to be vastly greater than any variation introduced by the borate complexation which had a negligible effect on the metabolic mapping and classification of samples.
PMC2721977	A00009	Whilst caution is indicated in the assignment of biomarker signals where metabolites have diol groupings or where there are adjacent hydroxyl and carboxylate functions, it is concluded that borate preservation is “fit-forpurpose” for _1 H NMR-based epidemiological studies since the essential biochemical classification features of the samples are robustly maintained.

PMC2721977	A02010	Both borate and azide have been widely used as a preservatives for urine as they are highly effective as antimicrobial agents and easy to use in the field for epidemiological studies.
PMC2721977	A02011	_– Of these two commonly-used preservatives, borate is preferred since it is much less toxic and reactive than azide which has also been reported to accelerate the hydrolysis of esterified metabolites.
PMC2721977	A02012	However, borate is reactive towards diols (particularly vicinal) and compounds with adjacent hydroxyl and carboxylate functional groups such as are found in many common metabolites including carbohydrates, polyols, alditols and hydroxylated fatty acids.
PMC2721977	A02013	Indeed, the capacity for borate to bind to vicinal diols has been widely exploited analytically in the production of phenyl-boronate sorbents and phases that can be used to extract and isolate suitable diols including sugars and drug glucuronides.
PMC2721977	A02014	Borate in aqueous solution acts as a Lewis acid since it exists mainly as the fully hydrated B(OH)_4 _− ion, (B(OH)_3 + H_2 O ↔ B(OH)_4 _− + H_+ ).
PMC2721977	A02015	Borate can form complexes with alcohols (ROH) to yield neutral esters such as B(OR)_3 as shown in ._, The ion [B(OH)_4 ]_− (aq) also readily forms anionic 1:1 and 1:2 complexes with carbohydrates and most polyols possessing 1,2 substitution_, and 1,3 substitution,_, and molecules containing dicarboxylic acids and diketones may also form complexes._, These complexation reactions are readily reversible and a number of measurements of equilibrium constants have been published, including through the use of _11 B NMR spectroscopy.
PMC2721977	A02016	The equilibrium constants and stoichiometry of the complexed species are also highly pH dependent and mass spectrometry has also been used to successfully characterize borate/diol complexes.
PMC2721977	A02017	While data exist on complexes of borate in various solvents,_, multiple borate complexes with a range of metabolites have not been well characterized, especially in terms of the kinetics and molecular dynamics of ligand exchange although this is not a primary purpose of our study.
PMC2721977	A02018	In this study, we have investigated the consequences of borate addition on the _1 H NMR spectral profiles of urinary metabolites, in terms of effects on proton chemical shifts and T _1 and T _2 relaxation times across a range of borate concentrations and specimen storage times.
PMC2721977	A02020	Direct infusion electrospray mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was also used to confirm the formation and stoichiometry of borate complexes using standard solutions.
PMC2721977	A02021	The main aim was to evaluate possible influences of borate complexation on sample classification error in metabonomic studies, on potential consequent biomarker mis-assignment and hence to asses the extent to which borate preservation of epidemiological urine samples is “fit-for-purpose” for large scale human metabonomics and molecular phenotyping investigations.
PMC2721977	D00002	Complexation with borate is one such source of variation in metabolic profiles and, as this is a widely used urinary preservative, it is important to assess its influence on spectral metabolite profiles.
PMC2721977	D00003	Borate has been used for urine sample preservation in a large number of clinical and epidemiologic studies for many decades.
PMC2721977	D00005	In comparison to biochemistry, modern analytical techniques such as _1 H NMR spectroscopy provide information across the full range of metabolites in human urine, so it is likely that complexation with borate can affect the NMR spectral analysis.
PMC2721977	D00006	However, previous chemometric investigations have shown that the presence of borate does not in itself impair classification of samples.
PMC2721977	D00007	This is consistent with other data, which shows that borate does not interfere with standard clinical assays such as those for determining urinary creatinine or albumin.
PMC2721977	D00009	For this investigation, the spectral profiles of urine samples preserved with various borate concentrations covering the range expected in epidemiologic investigation were compared.
PMC2721977	D00010	A new visualization technique (TOPSY) in which the measured T _1 or T _2 relaxation times of nuclei contributing to the NMR spectra are color-coded onto the urinary spectra enabled immediate comparison of metabolite complex signals that are changed in relaxation times due to borate complexation and assisted in the identification of those metabolites that interact with borate.
PMC2721977	D00012	In addition to identifying metabolites that were affected by borate, from a population screening perspectives, it is important to determine how the concentration of borate affect _1 H NMR spectral profiles globally.
PMC2721977	D00013	It was shown that the overall changes in the urinary spectral profile caused by borate addition are negligible compared with the physiological and metabolic differences between the individuals, despite minor spectral changes due to interactions between borate and citrate, mannitol, methylmalonate and α-hydroxyisobutyrate.
PMC2721977	D00014	Also, the addition of borate to urine has been shown to inhibit bacterial growth and therefore preserve levels of ethyl glucuronide, (a more reliable marker of chronic alcohol consumption than ethanol), a matter of particular interest to the INTERMAP study given the association of alcohol intake with blood pressure.
PMC2721977	D00015	Moreover, borate has been shown to be a suitable urinary preservative for the purpose of proteomic studies.
PMC2721977	D00017	We concluded that the overall changes in the urinary spectral profile caused by borate are negligible in comparison with inter-individual biological variation and that this method of preservation is fit for purpose in large-scale metabolic epidemiology screening study.
PMC2721977	M01000	Ten aliquots were prepared from a 24 hour human urine from a Caucasian male containing variable amounts of borate (0, 3.07, 6.15, 9.22, 12.29, 16.90, 21.51, 24.58, 27.66 and 30.73 mM) to mimic possible variation of boric acid concentration in specimens from epidemiological studies.
PMC2721977	M01002	Prior to analysis, 300 µL of urine were mixed with 200 µL of buffer (0.2 M Na_2 HPO_4 , 1 mM 3-(trimethylsilyl)-2,2,3,3-d_4 -propionic acid (TSP), 10% (v/v) D_2 O, pH 7.4) and transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes.
PMC2721977	M02007	Standard 1-dimensional NMR spectra were also measured on model solutions, prepared as 1:1 metabolite: borate ratio (10 mM each), at _1 H observation frequencies of 400 MHz, 600 MHz and 800 MHz.
PMC2721977	M02008	These three observation frequencies were used in order to maximise the opportunity to observe the chemical shift changes and chemical exchange effects of any borate complexation.
PMC2721977	M03002	This simplified approach using segmented integral data was used because the aim of the analysis was to assess the effect of borate on PCA mapping positions and not to evaluate the spectra in terms of potential biochemical biomarkers.
PMC2721977	M06000	The following solutions were analysed (all at 10 mM): mannitol, citrate, methylmalonate, 2-hydroxybutyrate, borate, plus each standard compound at 10 mM with 10 mM borate.
PMC2721977	M06004	The instrument was operated with leucine enkephalin employed as the lock-spray (Waters Corporation, Milford, USA) solution at a concentration of 200 pg/µL, infused into the instrument at 20 µL/min, with scans to average set to 3.
PMC2721977	R00000	_1 H NMR spectra from urine specimens stored for 24 hours at room temperature supplemented with 0 and 30.73 mM borate are shown in , respectively.
PMC2721977	R00002	For example, the α-hydroxyisobutyrate methyl singlet resonance at δ 1.36 with no borate present ( (inset, labelled 1)) appears as two singlets in the same urine sample after addition of 30.73 mM borate (, inset labelled 1).
PMC2721977	R00003	Thus it appears that α-hydroxyisobutyrate exists as both the free substance and the borate complex in slow exchange.
PMC2721977	R00004	A similar behavior is observed for the methylmalonate methyl doublet resonance at δ1.25, (inset, labeled 2).
PMC2721977	R00006	Although not visible in because of the complexity of the spectra, when the spectra are expanded, changes in the appearance of the peaks assigned to citrate and mannitol are also visible.
PMC2721977	R00007	Typical _1 H NMR spectra of control human urine samples containing: (A) no borate; (B) expansion of the region between δ1.1–1.4 from A; (C) the same sample with added 30.73 mM borate; (D) expansion of the region between δ1.1–1.4 from C. Peaks annotated “1” and “2” correspond to α-hydroxyisobutyric acid and methylmalonic acid, respectively, either free (in A and B) or in complex with borate (in C and D).
PMC2721977	R00008	Given the complexity of _1 H NMR spectra of urine, the regions of the spectra where the citrate and mannitol peaks appear were also investigated using model solutions and a range of NMR observation frequencies (_1 H observation at 400, 600 and 800 MHz).
PMC2721977	R00010	These three observation frequencies were used in an attempt to maximize the visualization of effects due to any differences in exchange rates between the metabolite and the borate. _1 H NMR spectra of a standard solution containing: (A–C) citrate, (D–F) citrate/borate complex, (G–I) mannitol, (J–L) mannitol/borate complex.
PMC2721977	R00013	The NMR peaks for citrate comprise a standard AB pattern at all frequencies (as seen in ) where the CH_2 protons are non-equivalent.
PMC2721977	R00014	On complexation with borate, the exchange between free metabolite and the borate complex is slow on the NMR time scale and separate peaks were observed for the two species at all observation frequencies, although this is best visualized at 800 MHz where the chemical shift difference is greatest.
PMC2721977	R00016	The situation for mannitol complexation is slightly different and the peaks observed for free mannitol are given in .
PMC2721977	R00017	On complexation with borate, the peak pattern is essentially unchanged and the peaks are merely broadened at all observation frequencies.
PMC2721977	R00022	Direct infusion ESI analysis of a solution of 10 mM citrate plus 10 mM boric acid gave distinct peaks in negative ion mode at m/z 191.12, m/z 390.25 and m/z 391.24.
PMC2721977	R00023	Through comparison with the citrate standard alone, these were deduced to correspond to the [M-H]_− ion of citrate (m/z 191.0) and a borate-citrate complex comprising two citrate, plus one borate ion.
PMC2721977	R00024	Specifically, m/z 390.25 and m/z 391.24 coincide with the mass of citrate-[_10 B]-citrate and citrate-[_11 B]-citrate, while a smaller peak at m/z 392.25 is citrate-[_11 B]-citrate with one _13 C atom.
PMC2721977	R00026	This was also seen with a solution of 10 mM mannitol plus 10 mM borate, where a peak corresponding to free mannitol was observed at m/z 181.08 and a borate-mannitol complex comprising two mannitol molecules plus one borate molecule at m/z
PMC2721977	R00028	The smaller peak at m/z 372.16 is mannitol-[_11 B]-mannitol with one _13 C atom.
PMC2721977	R00029	Finally, α-hydroxy-isobutyrate (α-HIBA) also formed a complex with borate, again 2:1 α-HIBA: borate.
PMC2721977	R00032	The smaller peak at m/z 216.15 is α-HIBA-[_11 B]- α-HIBA with one _13 C atom.
PMC2721977	R00034	However, based on the borate concentrations used in this study, it appears that the urinary complexes observed by _1 H NMR spectroscopy were in most likely to have 1:2 borate:metabolite stoichiometry although lower abundance species may also be present, they do not appear to contribute significantly to the NMR spectra.
PMC2721977	R00035	Direct infusion (negative mode) ESI spectrum of a sample containing equal molar (A) citrate:borate, (B) mannitol:borate; (C) α-hydroxyisobutyrate:borate in water.
PMC2721977	R01000	Although in the above examples the interaction of borate with specific metabolites had an effect on chemical shift and coupling patterns, it is conceivable that for other metabolites the effects of borate interaction might be more subtle.
PMC2721977	R01002	To visualize the potentially more subtle effects of borate complexation across the whole biofluid spectrum and between spectra, a new method for depicting variations in T _1 and T _2 relaxation times, namely, T _1 or T _2 ordered projection spectroscopy (TOPSY) has been developed, and this was applied to the urine specimens containing three concentrations of borate (0, 3.07 and 30.73 mM)
PMC2721977	R01006	600 MHz TOPSY spectra from a quality control urine sample supplemented with different amounts of borate.
PMC2721977	R01007	(A and D) borate-free urine sample, (B and E) the same urine sample supplemented with 3.07 mM borate and (C and F) the same urine sample supplemented with 30.7 mM borate.
PMC2721977	R01012	Although it is the protons that are characterized by the relaxation times, an “effective” or value can be calculated for each spectral data point and by this means the differences in the relaxation times (both T _1 and T _2 ) between samples in are seen, highlighting the resonances that are affected by borate preservation.
PMC2721977	R01013	By examination of the TOPSY plot based on the _1 H relaxation times, it can be seen that addition of borate simply causes a general reduction of values across the whole spectrum.
PMC2721977	R01014	Thus peaks colored red without borate addition become orange/yellow, and those originally colored blue become cyan.
PMC2721977	R01015	This effect is probably due to an overall effect of borate on the solution, possibly caused by a slight increase in solution viscosity which would cause a reduction of small molecule values.
PMC2721977	R01016	This also indicates that the relative peak intensities are also unlikely to be affected by borate addition and if data were to be acquired under partially saturating NMR conditions, borate addition would not cause any additional problems of quantitation.
PMC2721977	R01018	The two main effects are a shortening of the citrate proton values after addition of borate and the lengthening of the ’s of protons giving rise to specific carbohydrate resonances assignable to mannitol.
PMC2721977	R02000	To investigate the detailed effects of borate on the global statistical mapping of urinary metabolic NMR data, spectral profiles of urine containing 4 concentrations of borate (0, 3.07, 16.90, and 30.73 mM) at 9 successive time points over 12 months (see Methods) were acquired at 400 MHz.
PMC2721977	R02002	Here, each data point represents one spectral profile color-coded to indicate the concentration of borate.
PMC2721977	R02003	Differences caused by variation in concentrations of borate were largely described by the first principal component.
PMC2721977	R02005	Close inspection of the spectra indicated that this sample contained mannitol, thus explaining the majority of the observed variation in this PCA model.
PMC2721977	R02007	(A) PC1 v. PC2 scores plot of _1 H NMR spectral data from urine samples with varying borate concentrations and storage times.
PMC2721977	R02008	The four concentrations of borate are 0 (green), 3.07(blue), 16.90 (red) and 30.73 (black) mM in urine at 9 time points over a period of 12 months; (B) PCA loading plot for the scores in A; (C) PC1 v. PC2 scores plot of _1 H NMR spectral data from samples with varying borate concentrations (0, 3.07, 16.90 and 30.73 mM in urine) shown in red, and 200 urine sample from a typical western population shown in black; (D) PCA loading plot for the scores in (C).
PMC2721977	R02010	Finally, to investigate the extent of this within-individual variation due to varying borate concentrations and time compared with inter-individual variation in a metabolic analysis of epidemiologic dataset, a range of urine samples containing 10 concentrations of borate (0, 3.07, 6.15, 9.22, 12.29, 16.90, 21.51, 24.58, 27.66 and 30.73 mM) were added to a set of human urine samples collected previously (n = 200).
PMC2721977	R02012	In the resulting scores plot of the first two principal components based on the _1 H NMR spectra, the specimens with varying concentrations of borate are colored red and the urine population metabolic dataset are black.
PMC2721977	R02014	From these results, it is clear that the variation associated with borate concentration is negligible compared with the inter-individual biological/biochemical variation in the population samples.
PMC2741455	M01002	Serum samples were thawed, and proteins precipitated by addition of acetonitrile to the serum sample in a 5:1 ratio.
PMC2741455	R04006	Twelve of the SVMRFE_NL-selected features from the multimode dataset were tentatively identified as endogeneous carboxylic acids, peptides, glycerophospholipids and hormones.
PMC2741455	R04009	One of these features was attributed to either lithocholic acid glycine conjugate or any of eight glycerophosphocholine isomers while the other was attributed to either any of eighteen glycerophosphocholine lipids containing a single double bond or to any of thirty-two lipids containing four double bonds.
PMC2741455	R04010	Examples of some of the other compounds that could be tentatively matched to the elemental formulae obtained in this investigation include 12-hydroxy-8E,10E-heptadecadienoic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, GlnHisAla, DHEA sulfate, PC(P-16:0/0:0), PC(10:0/4:0), PE(9:0/10:0), LysoPC(18:2(9Z,12Z)), PE-NMe(18:1(19E)/18:1(9E)).

PMC2741455	R04013	The final unique feature, which had an accuracy of 14.8 ppm and a matching score of 98.8, was attributed to any of eleven bile acid isomers, such as 5β -chol-9(11)-en-24-oic acid.
PMC2741455	R04014	Although metabolites such as lysophosphatidic acid and lipid associated sialic acid, that have been investigated as metabolic biomarkers for ovarian cancer in literature [-], were not pinpointed in the study, the presence of several endogenous lipids as well as other endogenous metabolites in the set of selected features suggests that this approach has merit and should be further explored.
PMC2771025	A00000	A significant body of literature indicates that melatonin, a hormone primarily produced nocturnally by the pineal gland, is an important scavenger of hydroxyl radicals and other reactive oxygen species.
PMC2771025	A00001	Melatonin may also lower the rate of DNA base damage resulting from hydroxyl radical attack and increase the rate of repair of that damage.
PMC2771025	A00002	This paper reports the results of a study relating the level of overnight melatonin production to the overnight excretion of the two primary urinary metabolites of the repair of oxidatively damaged guanine in DNA.
PMC2771025	A01001	Total overnight creatinine-adjusted 6-sulphatoxymelatonin (aMT6s/Cr) has been shown to be highly correlated with total overnight melatonin production.
PMC2771025	A01002	Urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-guanine (8-oxoGua) results from the repair of DNA or RNA guanine via the nucleobase excision repair pathway, while urinary 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) may possibly result from the repair of DNA guanine via the nucleotide excision repair pathway.
PMC2771025	A01003	Total overnight urinary levels of 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua are therefore a measure of total overnight guanine DNA damage.
PMC2771025	A01004	8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry assay.
PMC2771025	A01006	Comparisons between the mothers, fathers, and daughters were calculated for aMT6s/Cr, 8-oxodG, and 8-oxoGua.
PMC2771025	A01007	Regression analyses of 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua on aMT6s/Cr were conducted for mothers, fathers, and daughters separately, adjusting for age and BMI (or weight).
PMC2771025	A02000	Among the mothers, age range 42-80, lower melatonin production (as measured by aMT6s/CR) was associated with significantly higher levels of 8-oxodG (p < 0.05), but not with 8-oxoGua.
PMC2771025	A02001	Among the fathers, age range 46-80, lower melatonin production was associated with marginally higher levels of 8-oxoGua (p < 0.07), but not with 8-oxodG.
PMC2771025	A02002	Among the daughters, no relationship was found between melatonin levels and either 8-oxodG or 8-oxoGua levels.
PMC2771025	A03000	Low levels of endogenous melatonin production among older individuals may lead to higher levels of oxidatively damaged guanine in DNA, thereby possibly increasing the risk of developing cancer.

PMC2771025	D00015	In addition to _• OH, melatonin also scavenges hydrogen peroxide (H_2 O_2 ), nitric oxide (NO), peroxynitrite anion (ONOO- ), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), and singlet oxygen (_1 O_2 ) [-]. _
PMC2771025	D00018	Hydrogen peroxide does not appear to react directly with DNA, but does undergo chemical reactions within the cell nucleus which produces _• OH, e.g., reaction with Fe_+2 .
PMC2771025	D00019	On the other hand, _1 O_2 readily oxidizes guanine bases in DNA, but is neither as reactive and nor as cytotoxic as _• OH. _•
PMC2771025	D00020	OH appears not to be removed by antioxidative enzymes, but rather is detoxified by certain direct radical scavengers, such as melatonin.
PMC2771025	D00024	Human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) is a BER enzyme responsible for identifying and assisting in the removal of oxidized guanine.
PMC2771025	D00025	Preliminary animal evidence indicates that melatonin may upregulate ERCC6.
PMC2771025	D00027	hOGG1 is inhibited by nitric oxide (NO).
PMC2771025	D00028	Melatonin generally inhibits nitric oxide availability and thus may also more directly upregulate hOGG1.
PMC2771025	D00029	This report describes the results of what appears to be the first published study in humans of the relationships between endogenous melatonin production levels and levels of oxidatively damaged DNA.
PMC2771025	D00030	Because total overnight urinary aMT6s/Cr is highly correlated with total overnight melatonin production, the relationships between 8-oxodG, 8-oxoGua and aMT6s/Cr translate into similar relationships between 8-oxodG, 8-oxoGua and melatonin production.
PMC2771025	D00031	Among the mothers, aged 43.5 - 80.7, higher levels of nocturnal melatonin production, as measured by total nocturnal urinary aMT6s/Cr, were associated with lower levels of total nocturnal urinary 8-oxodG. This translates into lower levels of oxidatively damaged guanine in DNA because nearly all such damage is repaired.
PMC2771025	D00032	Interestingly, fathers, aged 46.1 - 80.9, did not have an inverse relationship between total nocturnal urinary aMT6s/Cr and total nocturnal urinary 8-oxodG.
PMC2771025	D00033	Rather, they had a marginally significant inverse relationship between total nocturnal urinary aMT6s/Cr and total nocturnal urinary 8-oxoGua.
PMC2771025	D00035	For the oldest daughters, aged 18.6 - 51.6, there was no relationship between total nocturnal melatonin production levels and total nocturnal urinary 8-oxodG or 8-oxoGua.
PMC2771025	D00036	These data indicate that melatonin may influence the pathways used to repair oxidatively damaged guanine in DNA differently in older men than in older women.
PMC2771025	D00038	In addition, the mothers' nocturnal urinary levels of 8-oxodG, as a function of aMT6s/Cr, clearly appear to have a linear component with a negative slope (Figure ).
PMC2771025	D00039	The fathers' nocturnal urinary levels of 8-oxoGua may have a non-linear relationship with aMT6s/Cr.
PMC2771025	D00040	The percentages of variance in 8-oxodG (mothers) and 8-oxoGua (fathers) accounted for by aMT6s/Cr are not particularly large (12.4% and 8.4%, respectively).
PMC2771025	D00041	There are many other factors which influence the level of an individual's oxidatively damaged guanine in DNA.
PMC2771025	D00042	However, the level of production of melatonin appears to be a significant factor.
PMC2771025	M00000	Urine samples, stored at -20°C for less than 1-2 years, were available from an earlier cross-sectional study designed to model the relationship between mother and daughter levels of melatonin production, after adjusting the daughter's melatonin level for the father's melatonin level.
PMC2771025	M01000	Fifty-five (55) nuclear biologic families were recruited in an earlier cross-sectional study designed to model the relationship between mother and daughter levels of melatonin production, after adjusting the daughter's melatonin level for the father's melatonin level.
PMC2771025	M01002	No subject was taking a melatonin supplement.
PMC2771025	M03004	Thus, seasonal variation of melatonin production within families is not an issue.
PMC2771025	M04002	Creatinine was measured using the Vitros CREA Slide (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc.) method.
PMC2771025	M04004	8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua were measured simultaneously using high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI).
PMC2771025	M04005	The units of measurement are as follows: aMT6s - ng/ml; creatinine - mg/ml; 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua - nmol/litre.
PMC2771025	M04007	The 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua assays were performed in Dr. Poulsen's laboratory in Denmark.
PMC2771025	M04008	Total overnight 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua were not adjusted for total creatinine, as is commonly done for spot samples but not 24-hour urine samples.
PMC2771025	M04010	(1998) found that the Pearson correlation between total 24-hour urinary 8-oxodG accumulation and an independent creatinine-adjusted morning spot measurement was only 0.5.
PMC2771025	M04011	In the present study, the Pearson correlations between total overnight accumulation and creatinine-adjusted 8-oxodG from the same urine sample were 0.52 (mothers),
PMC2771025	M04016	For 8-oxoGua, the correlations were 0.90 (mothers), 0.90 (fathers), and 0.72 (oldest daughters) in the present study.
PMC2771025	M04017	While the data to determine the correlations between complete overnight and 24-hour 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua accumulation are not available, it seems reasonable that complete overnight urine samples (unadjusted) are more highly correlated with 24-hour urine samples (unadjusted) than are creatinine-adjusted complete overnight urine samples.
PMC2771025	M04023	Thus, the number of samples for 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua with valid data is lower than 55 within the mother, father, and oldest daughter groups due to some chromatographic assay problems.
PMC2771025	M04024	Specifically, assay problems resulted in the loss of 9% - 18% of the 8-oxodG data and 13% - 27% of the 8-oxoGua data among the mothers, fathers and oldest daughters.
PMC2771025	M04025	The limit of detection for both 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua is approximately 0.5 nanomoles (nmol) per litre.
PMC2771025	M05001	Paired t-tests were performed to compare aMT6s/Cr, total 8-oxodG, and total 8-oxoGua between mothers, fathers, and the daughter, in a pairwise manner.
PMC2771025	M05003	The relationships between (1) overnight urinary aMT6s/Cr and (2) total urinary overnight 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua were derived using regression analyses, with age and BMI (or weight) as the covariates.
PMC2771025	R00000	Inclusion of current exercise, smoking, alcohol consumption, red meat consumption, parity, and spontaneous abortion history in the analyses did not affect the relationships between creatinine-adjusted aMT6s and 8-oxodG or 8-oxoGua (data not shown).
PMC2771025	R00006	Mean 8-oxoGua urinary excretion levels were 6-8 times that of mean urinary 8-oxodG levels.
PMC2771025	R00009	Descriptive Statistics by Mothers, Fathers, and Daughters For puposes of possible comparison with published studies which used creatinine-adjusted 8-oxodG and/or 8-oxoGua values, the creatinine-adjusted means (standard deviations) in nmol/mmol are as follows: (1) 8-oxodG: Mothers - 1.5 (0.53); Fathers - 1.3 (0.64); Oldest Daughters - 1.3 (0.49); (2) 8-oxoGua: Mothers - 11.7 (11.43); Fathers - 10.3 (10.68); Oldest Daughters - 9.0 (8.17).
PMC2771025	R00010	Table provides pairwise comparisons of aMT6s/Cr, 8-oxodG, and 8-oxoGua values between mothers, fathers, and daughters.
PMC2771025	R00013	Fathers had a significantly higher urinary 8-oxodG mean than did the mothers (p < 0.001), while their mean 8-oxoGua level was marginally (p = 0.08) higher.
PMC2771025	R00014	Paired Comparisons of Mothers, Fathers, and Daughters: Creatinine-Adjusted aMT6s, 8-oxodG, and 8-oxoGua.
PMC2771025	R00019	Pearson correlations were also calculated between urinary 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua for the mothers, fathers, and daughters, separately.
PMC2771025	R00021	Thus, only the daughters' urinary 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua correlation was significantly different from 0.
PMC2771025	R00022	Table provides the analytic regression results of urinary 8-oxodG and 8-oxoGua on aMT6s/Cr alone and on aMT6s/CR, age, and BMI combined for mothers, fathers, and oldest daughters.

BMI was marginally positively associated (p = 0.097), while weight was significantly positively associated (p = 0.04; data not shown) with 8-oxodG; 3. among all fathers, there was a. a marginally significant (p = 0.063 and 0.065 with BMI or weight in the model, respectively) decrease in 8-oxoGua as endogenous overnight urinary aMT6s/Cr increased; 4. among the fathers older than the oldest daughter (age 51.6), a. the inverse association between 8-oxoGua and aMT6s/CR was statistically significant (p = 0.03 for either BMI or weight in the model); 5. among the oldest daughters, there was a. a marginally significant (p < 0.07 and < 0.08 for BMI and weight, respectively) increase in 8-oxoGua as age increased.
PMC2771025	R00027	Table provides the correlations and percent of variation explained (R_2 ) between aMT6s/Cr and 8-oxodG (mothers) and 8-oxoGua (fathers).
PMC2771025	R00028	The percent of variance explained by aMT6s/Cr pertains to the univariate regression and is 12.4% and 8.4% for the mothers' 8-oxodG and fathers' 8-oxoGua, respectively.
PMC2771025	R00029	Correlations and R_2 for Urinary Creatinine-Adjusted aMT6s and 8-oxodG (Mothers) and 8-oxoGua (Fathers) Figure and Figure provide scatter plots of aMT6s/Cr and 8-oxodG (mothers) and 8-oxoGua (fathers) with the univariate regression lines added.
PMC2771025	R00031	A straight line regression is appropriate for the mothers' 8-oxodG data, based on the scatter plot (Figure ).
PMC2771025	R00032	However for the fathers' 8-oxoGua data, the scatter plot (Figure ) shows there to be 3 very influential data points: the three points in the upper left-hand corner (low aMT6s/Cr and high 8-oxoGua).

PMC2771025	R00038	However, we conducted further linear regression analyses on the fathers' 8-oxoGua data transformed in four ways: natural logarithm, square root, reciprocal, and logistic.
PMC2771025	R00042	All four analyses, using the models with age and BMI or with age and weight, showed a marginally significant inverse association between the transformed 8-oxoGua and aMT6s/Cr values.
PMC2775672	A00000	Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is associated with weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, and a reduction in co-morbidities such as diabetes and coronary heart disease.
PMC2775672	A01002	The abundance of 48% (83 of 172) of the measured metabolites changed significantly within the first 3 months post RYGB (p<0.05), including sphingosines, unsaturated fatty acids, and branched chain amino acids.
PMC2775672	A01003	Dividing subjects into obese (n = 9) and obese/diabetic (n = 5) groups identified 8 metabolites that differed consistently at all time points and whose serum levels changed following RYGB: asparagine, lysophosphatidylcholine (C18:2), nervonic (C24:1) acid, p-Cresol sulfate, lactate, lycopene, glucose, and mannose.
PMC2775672	A01005	Of these, nervonic acid was significantly and negatively correlated with HOMA-IR (p = 0.001, R = −0.55).
PMC2775672	D00000	Gastric bypass surgery results in significant metabolic changes associated with weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis, and a reduction in co-morbidities such as diabetes and coronary heart disease.
PMC2775672	D00005	Decreases in BMI, body weight, fat mass, fat free mass, triglycerides, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and leptin were observed following RYGB.
PMC2775672	D00010	Three of the 5 OB/D subjects demonstrated a resolution of diabetes, as suggested by the normalization of glucose levels and the fact they no longer needed anti-diabetic and dyslipidemia treatments after 3 months.
PMC2775672	D00017	The improvements in dyslipidemia associated with gastric bypass were previously demonstrated by increases in HDL-cholesterol and reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides , .
PMC2775672	D00019	Although diet restriction is a considerably less dramatic weight loss situation than RYGB, the authors found that diet-induced weight loss led to decreases in triglycerides and phospholipids, but no changes to lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and sphingolipid species .
PMC2775672	D00020	The lack of changes in LPC and sphingolipids was surprising when considering previous animal studies have shown that LPC species and sphingolipids are increased with obesity and in situations marked by impaired insulin sensitivity , , ; however, it is plausible that less drastic weight-loss paradigms such as exercise and diet restriction do not affect insulin sensitivity sufficiently to detect changes in LPC and sphingolipids.
PMC2775672	D00021	While many lipid species were found to increase in subjects post RYGB, several lipids were of particular interest, namely nervonic acid and various sphingosine species (3-O-methylsphingosine, threo-sphingosine, erythro-sphingosine, and 5-O-methylsphingosine).
PMC2775672	D00025	More specifically, intramyocellular sphingolipids may cause insulin resistance by disrupting insulin signaling pathways in the muscle .
PMC2775672	D00026	Previous reports have revealed that the level of muscle ceramide enriched with nervonic acid is negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity, but the authors did not examine plasma lipid levels.
PMC2775672	D00027	Recently, Haus and colleagues have found that serum ceramide enriched with nervonic acid is inversely correlated with insulin sensitivity ; however, the authors did not determine free levels of circulating nervonic acid.
PMC2775672	D00028	In light of our findings demonstrating increases in total serum nervonic acid post RYGB and its negative correlation with insulin resistance, it would be interesting to simultaneously generate metabolomic datasets in both the muscle and plasma before and after RYGB in order to determine whether the release of IMCL is responsible for the increased serum lipid levels we observed.
PMC2775672	D00032	The decrease in valine was paralleled by an increase in serum β-aminoisobutyric acid, a product of valine catabolism.
PMC2775672	D00034	The subjects in this independent study showed a significant decrease in body weight and plasma glucose levels, but no improvement in insulin sensitivity; however, this may be a result of the increased inter-individual variability associated with the use of a mixed-sex cohort.
PMC2775672	D00038	Specifically, elevated BCAA levels were associated with improved glucose and insulin tolerance in BCATm−/− mice, while decreases in BCAA levels are associated with improved glucose and insulin tolerance in humans following RYGB.
PMC2775672	D00047	We have identified a significant increase in thyroxine (T4), the major form of thyroid hormone found in blood, post surgery that may underlie the improvement in thyroid function and signaling seen in subjects after RYGB.
PMC2775672	D00048	The abundance of protein-bound uremic retention solutes (p-cresol sulfate, indole-3-acetic acid, 3-indoxylsulfuric acid, and 3-hydroxyindole) was increased post RYGB and, several of the precursor metabolites were decreased after bypass surgery, such as tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan .
PMC2775672	D00050	Indeed, p-cresol and indole are metabolites generated by the intestinal microbiota, suggesting that RYGB may lead to alterations in the gut microbial composition.
PMC2775672	D00052	More specifically, beta-sitosterol and campesterol were decreased, and lycopene and beta-carotene were increased.
PMC2775672	D00054	Although controversial, plasma increases in plant sterols (e.g. campesterol and beta-sitosterol) have been associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease ; thus our data may suggest RYGB reduces the abundance of these risk factors.
PMC2775672	D00061	Secondly, metabolite profiling revealed that glucose was greater in OB/D subjects compared to OB subjects at all three time points (p<0.05).
PMC2775672	D00062	Thirdly, the metabolite that differed the most between OB and OB/D subjects was 1,5-anhydrosorbitol (p<0.001), a biomarker currently used for assessing glycemic control .
PMC2775672	D00064	Furthermore, blood levels of 1,5-anhydrosorbitol are inversely related to glucose, which our data also confirms.
PMC2775672	D00069	Eight metabolites were found to both differentiate OB from OB/D subjects consistently at all time points and change over time (T0 vs. other two time points T3, T6): lycopene, asparagine, lysophosphatidylcholine (C18:2), p-Cresol sulfate, lactate, nervonic acid (C24:cis1), glucose, and mannose.
PMC2775672	D00071	Nervonic acid was found to be negatively correlated with HOMA-IR, which is of particular interest considering that this fatty acid has previously been positioned as having preventive effects on obesity-related metabolic parameters .
PMC2775672	D00072	While little else is known regarding its functional role in obesity, it will be interesting to determine whether nervonic acid induces or is simply a consequence of the metabolic improvements seen post RYGB.
PMC2775672	M01006	These five subjects (referred to hereon as the OB/D group) were treated with metformin and hypolipemic drugs (either fibrates or statins).
PMC2775672	M01010	Furthermore, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was systematically performed before RYGB and confirmed that all patients in the OB group had glucose levels less than 11 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) in the two hours following a 75 g oral glucose challenge.
PMC2775672	M02001	Blood samples were obtained at each time point and stored at −20°C until used to assess lipid, insulin and glucose values (enabling the determination of insulin sensitivity parameters), leptin, and many other factors, outlined in .
PMC2775672	M03003	Serum iron, ferritin, the coefficient of saturation of iron in transferrin, vitamins (A, D, E, B1, B12, B9), micronutrients (selenium and zinc), and calcium were measured using routine bio-clinical tests.
PMC2775672	M04002	SPE-LC-MS/MS (solid phase extraction-LC-MS/MS; Symbiosis Pharma (Spark, Emmen, Netherlands) coupled to an Applied Biosystems API4000 MS/MS-System (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany)) was used for the determination of catecholamine and steroid levels.
PMC2775672	M04006	To aid interpretation, metabolites were grouped into 11 biological categories: amino acid and related; carbohydrates and related; catecholamines and related; complex lipids and related; energy metabolism and organic acids; fatty acids (free and from lipids); purines, pyrimidines and related; steroids and related; vitamins, cofactors and related; miscellaneous; and unknown metabolites.
PMC2775672	M05001	Subsequently polar and non-polar fractions were separated for both GC-MS and LC-MS/MS analysis by adding water and a mixture of ethanol and dichloromethane.
PMC2775672	M05002	For GC-MS analyses, the non-polar fraction was treated with methanol under acidic conditions to yield the fatty acid methyl esters derived from both free fatty acids and hydrolyzed complex lipids.
PMC2775672	M05003	The polar and non-polar fractions were further derivatized with O-methyl-hydroxyamine hydrochloride (20 mg/ml in pyridine, 50 ul) to convert oxo-groups to O-methyloximes and subsequently with a silylating agent (MSTFA, 50 ul) before GC-MS analysis .
PMC2775672	M05005	High performance LC (HPLC) was performed by gradient elution using methanol/water/formic acid on reversed phase separation columns.
PMC2775672	M06001	Catecholamines and their related metabolites were measured by online SPE-LC-MS/MS, as described by Yamada et al .
PMC2775672	R00001	The OB/D subjects were all treated with metformin and 2 of these subjects were additionally treated with insulin.
PMC2775672	R00004	Additionally, circulating triglycerides and leptin levels were decreased post surgery.
PMC2775672	R00005	There was a small, but significant, decrease in HDL-cholesterol between T0 and T3; however, HDL-cholesterol levels recovered by T6; as further supported by a lack of change in Apo-A1 levels between T0 and T6.
PMC2775672	R00007	Since insulin injections prevent an accurate measure of endogenous insulin and glucose levels, the 2 OB/D subjects treated with insulin were removed prior to evaluating insulin resistance with the HOMA.
PMC2775672	R00008	In the remaining 12 subjects, circulating glucose and insulin levels decreased significantly post RYGB.
PMC2775672	R00013	The OB/D subjects were treated with metformin and not with insulin.
PMC2775672	R00020	Blood glucose levels in three of the five subjects normalized after RYGB and anti-diabetic treatments were stopped, indicating a resolution of diabetes.
PMC2775672	R01008	Specifically, the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) decreased following RYGB.
PMC2775672	R01009	Further evidence for the regulation of valine catabolism in particular was provided by the increased serum abundance for β-aminoisobutyric acid, a product of valine catabolism.
PMC2775672	R01010	With regards to lipid metabolites, we observed increases in specific sphingosines, unsaturated fatty acids, and phospholipids, while ceramide (d18:1, C24:0), triglycerides, and saturated fatty acids decreased following RYGB.
PMC2775672	R02008	The top two metabolites common to each of the 3 lists were 1,5-anhydrosorbitol and ascorbic acid.
PMC2775672	R02009	Interestingly, 1,5-anhydrosorbitol is a biomarker currently used for assessing glycemic control.
PMC2775672	R02010	As blood glucose levels increase above the renal threshold for glucosuria, 1,5-anhydrosorbitol rapidly decreases .
PMC2775672	R02011	The current dataset shows that 1,5-anhydrosorbitol levels are significantly lower in OB/D versus OB subjects.
PMC2775672	R02012	Following RYGB, the levels of 1,5-anhydrosorbitol increased from T0→T3→T6, while glucose levels decreased.
PMC2775672	R02013	Furthermore, glucose also appears in , which serves to reinforce this result.
PMC2775672	R02014	The mixed-effects ANOVA model revealed a significant group:time interaction for 1,5-anhydrosorbitol.
PMC2775672	R02015	The second metabolite is ascorbic acid, whose abundance in serum decreased post surgery.
PMC2775672	R02016	OB/D subjects have greater levels of ascorbic acid versus OB subjects at all time points, despite both groups of subjects experiencing similar decreases in ascorbic acid levels post surgery.
PMC2775672	R02017	No significant interaction between group:time was identified for ascorbic acid.
PMC2775672	R02018	Deficiencies in vitamins are a documented side-effect of gastric bypass surgery , , therefore all subjects consumed a daily multi-vitamin containing approximately 120 mg of vitamin C post surgery.
PMC2775672	R02019	Thus serum vitamin C differences between OB and OB/D groups in this study are most likely not related to differences in nutritional supplementation.
PMC2775672	R02025	A significant increase in 1,5-anhydrosorbitol (1,5-AG) occurred at T6 vs. T0 in OB/D subjects, while a non-significant increase was seen in OB subjects (group:time interaction was allowed for by the linear model).
PMC2775672	R02027	For ascorbic acid, the ANOVA model did not detect group-specific changes over time (no group:time interaction), but indicated significant decreases from T0 to T6 in both groups.
PMC2775672	R02028	Overall, 1,5-anhydrosorbitol and ascorbic acid were significantly different at each time point between OB and OB/D subgroups (p<0.01, see ).
PMC2775672	R02029	The 15 remaining metabolites that differed between OB and OB/D subjects at all time points were asparagine, cysteine, lysophosphatidylcholine (C18:2), phosphatidylcholine (C16:0, C18:2), nervonic acid (C24:cis1), cholic acid, pantothenic acid, lycopene, lactate, testosterone-17-sulfate, p-Cresol sulfate, fructose-6-phosphate, glucose-1-phosphate, glucose, and mannose.
PMC2775672	R02031	Of the 15 aforementioned metabolites, the abundance of 8 metabolites changed significantly after surgery (i.e. are found in ): asparagine, lysophosphatidylcholine (C18:2), nervonic (C24:1) acid, p-Cresol sulfate, lactate, lycopene, glucose, and mannose.
PMC2775672	R02032	Lycopene, lysophosphatidylcholine, and nervonic acid serum levels were higher in OB subjects, while asparagine, p-Cresol sulfate, lactate, glucose and mannose were higher in OB/D subjects.
PMC2775672	R03002	Of the 8 metabolites examined, we identified a significant negative correlation between nervonic acid and HOMA-IR (p = 0.001, R = −0.55), i.e. HOMA-IR decreased as serum levels of nervonic acid increased.
PMC2775672	R03004	Furthermore, adjusting for BMI did not affect the significance of the correlation between nervonic acid and HOMA-IR.
PMC2775672	R03006	A significant increase in serum abundance of nervonic acid occurred following RYGB in both OB and OB/D subjects, as assessed using a mixed-effects ANOVA with group:time interaction (** p <0.01 versus T0).

PMC2789356	A02026	Creatinine normalization, on the other hand, originates from clinical chemistry and uses the fact that creatinine clearance in an organism is fairly constant.
PMC2789356	A02027	However, urinary creatinine concentrations can vary significantly with reference to, e.g., age, gender and time of urine collection.-
PMC2789356	A02028	Therefore, quantitative metabolite profiling relative to creatinine peak area may yield inaccurate results.

PMC2789356	A05006	Therefore, quantitative metabolite profiling relative to creatinine peak area may yield inaccurate results.
PMC2789356	D03002	To illustrate the point, and S10 demonstrate that an increased variance of lower-abundant peaks on the log scale persists after creatinine and total sum normalizations.
PMC2789356	D05018	VSN transformation is a preferred normalization for exploratory analysis such as PCA, and creatinine normalization is preferred for t-test.
PMC2789356	M00000	Sodium succinate dibasic, sodium fumarate dibasic, sodium 4-hydroxybenzoate, α-ketoglutaric acid sodium salt, 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, nicotinic acid sodium salt, and 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid-d_4 (TSP) sodium salt were from SigmaAldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), and used without further purification.
PMC2789356	M01003	The 6 samples were diluted using phosphate buffer (PH=7.4, final concentration of 0.2M) to prepare three sets of mixtures with three dilution levels : a set of 6 non-diluted samples, the same 6 samples diluted two-fold, and the same 6 samples diluted four-fold.
PMC2789356	M02000	500 μl spiked urine was mixed with 50 μl phosphate buffer (PH=7.4, final concentration 0.2 M), 50 μl D_2 O containing 0.511 mM TSP.
PMC2789356	M06000	Creatinine and total sum normalization define N =1/C , where C is the intensity of the creatinine peak for creatinine normalization, and the total sum of intensities of all peaks for the total sum normalization.
PMC2789356	R00006	Total sum, creatinine and VSN normalizations all account for the dilutions by setting the medians of peak intensities to a comparable level.
PMC2789356	R03007	Creatinine normalization leads to the lowest FPR curve among all normalization methods, indicating its superior performance.

PMC2789356	R05003	Due to the nature of the disease, the glucose region was removed from the raw spectra prior to normalization and analysis. and S8 show results of PCA on peak picked and log transformed data.
PMC2789356	R05006	Different normalization algorithms share a large portion of detected features arising from metabolites such as 3-hydroxybutyrate, acetone and acetoacetate.
PMC2789356	R05007	However, conclusions regarding the differential abundance of metabolites such as dimethylamine and formate depended on the normalization procedure, indicating that the choice can have important implications for interpretation of the results.
PMC2789356	R05008	The total sum normalization produces noticeably more differentiating features than creatinine and VSN, however the true proportion of false positives in this dataset is unknown.
PMC2919299	D00004	In individuals with T1DM, especially those with poorly controlled blood glucose, triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins (e.g. chylomicrons; very low density lipoprotein, VLDL; and LDL) are often elevated because of (1) increased VLDL production related to increased circulating glucose and free fatty acids due to lack of insulin, and (2) a reduction in the activity of chylomicron- and VLDL-catabolizing lipoprotein lipase, an insulin-regulated enzyme.
PMC2919299	D00005	In contrast, T1DM patients who have well-controlled blood glucose levels and no renal damage have serum lipid and lipoprotein levels similar to those of healthy controls.
PMC2919299	D00012	The lipid species that were most different between healthy controls and patients with T1DM belong to phosphatidylcholine-containing classes, such as lysoglycerophosphatidylcholine (LPC), glycerophosphatidylcholine (PC), and sphingomyelin (SM).
PMC2919299	D00013	Nine SM species were significantly decreased in individuals with T1DM relative to controls.
PMC2919299	D00014	Previous studies have also reported decreased plasma and serum SM levels in patients with T1DM relative to controls.
PMC2919299	D00015	Watała and Jóźwiak reported decreased levels of SM in both plasma and isolated LDL and HDL fractions from patients with T1DM relative to age- and sex-matched controls, based on thin layer chromatography.
PMC2919299	D00016	Decreased levels of SM have also been reported by others studying the phospholipid composition of HDL and apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein particles[],.
PMC2919299	D00017	Similarly, Orešič and colleagues reported a decrease in SM molecular species in type 1 diabetic patients relative to controls.
PMC2919299	D00019	The authors consistently detected 8 molecular species of SM, with 4 species (d18:1/16:0, d18:1/23:1, d18:1/24:0, and d18:1/25:1) detected in significantly (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 0.05) lower abundance in type 1 diabetic children before and after the appearance of autoantibodies, relative to healthy controls.
PMC2919299	D00020	In contrast, we found d16:1/24:0, d18:1/18:0, d18:1/18:1, d18:1/18:2, d18:1/20:0, d18:1/20:1, d18:1/24:1, d18:1/24:2, and d20:1/22:3 SM to be significantly decreased in patients relative to controls.
PMC2919299	D00021	In general, there was not a high degree of overlap in the SM molecular species identified between our study and that of Orešič and colleagues; however, this is not unexpected, as the ionization of molecules by ESI and their subsequent detection is a stochastic process that depends, among other things, on the efficiency of the front-end LC separation.
PMC2919299	D00022	The discrepancy in identified SM species may also be due to dietary differences among the individuals participating in the DASP and DIPP.
PMC2919299	D00023	Importantly, the overall trend of decreased SM in individuals with T1DM remains consistent between the two studies and is supported by other previous work [, ].
PMC2919299	D00024	Ten SM species determined to be significantly different (q < 0.05) by ANOVA are plotted.
PMC2919299	D00025	We also identified perturbations in other glycerophosphatidylcholine lipids, including LPC, PC, and ether PC.
PMC2919299	D00026	Orešič and colleagues reported decreased levels of ether PC in individuals with T1DM relative to controls; we identified 4 ether PC molecular species that were significantly decreased in recently diagnosed T1DM.
PMC2919299	D00027	In contrast, no solid conclusion could be drawn regarding LPC and PC.
PMC2919299	D00028	For LPC, half of the identified species were either significantly increased or decreased in T1DM.
PMC2919299	D00030	Consistent with our observations, other studies have reported perturbations in the glycerophosphatidylcholine lipid (lecithin) content of serum or isolated lipoprotein fractions, although these reports do not always agree in terms of increases or decreases in this lipid class in T1DM.
PMC2919299	D00031	For example, Ziegler et al. reported a depletion of glycerophosphatidylcholine lipids in serum and apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein fractions in individuals with T1DM who otherwise presented with a normal lipid profile relative to controls.
PMC2919299	D00032	Similarly, Bagdade and Subbaiah reported decreased SM, PC, and LPC in the HDL-containing fraction of plasma in women with T1DM relative to controls.
PMC2919299	D00033	These patients also presented with normal triglycerides, total and HDL-cholesterol, and lipoprotein phospholipids in whole plasma.
PMC2919299	D00034	However, in a separate study, the same authors reported significantly (p > 0.025) increased SM and PC in the HDL fraction of plasma in men with T1DM relative to controls.
PMC2919299	D00035	Rabini and colleagues also reported increased concentrations of LPC in plasma of T1DM individuals.
PMC2919299	D00036	These contradictions suggest that, aside from dietary differences and biological variation between healthy controls and patients, reported differences in glycerophosphatidylcholine lipid content of individuals may be due to differences in general phospholipid composition of individual lipoprotein particles as a result of T1DM.
PMC2919299	D00040	While SM was decreased in patients in all fractions (see above), LPC was decreased in patients in total plasma (p < 0.001) but increased in patients in the HDL fraction (p <0.002).
PMC2919299	D00041	In contrast, glycerophosphatidylethanolamine lipids (PE) were increased in patients in total plasma (p < 0.05) but were unchanged in the LDL and HDL fractions (similar to Watała and Jóźwiak, we identified 2 LPE and 1 PE molecular species as significantly increased in T1DM versus control).
PMC2919299	D00042	Glycerophosphatidylserine and glycerophosphatidylinositol lipids were decreased in patients in the LDL fraction (p < 0.001) but were unchanged in total plasma and not detected in the HDL fraction.
PMC2919299	D00045	Bagdade and Subbaiah propose that such abnormalities may compromise reverse cholesterol transport in diabetic patients and promote atherosclerosis.
PMC2919299	D00047	Oxidized phospholipids are implicated in many inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis [–], and their observed increase in individuals with recently diagnosed T1DM may be an indication of oxidative stress in these individuals.
PMC2919299	D00048	Finally, we identified 5 molecular species of triacylglyecerol (TAG) that were significantly decreased in T1DM, possibly indicating a recruitment of TAGs for energy production.
PMC2919299	M00006	Age Gender Race Status Serum glucose, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, and triglycerides were determined by enzymatic assays at the Northwest Lipid Metabolism and Diabetes Research Laboratory at the University of Washington (Seattle, WA), using appropriate Roche reagents (e.g. hexokinase for glucose) and a Roche Double Modular P Analytics automated analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN).
PMC2919299	M01000	Plasma and serum lipids were extracted in triplicate via the addition of 100 μL cold (−20ºC) chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) to 20 μL plasma, and the mixture was vortexed for 10 s.
PMC2919299	M01002	The lower chloroform phase was removed by pipetting and placed into a sterile, siliconized eppendorf tube, while the protein interlayer and upper aqueous phase were discarded.
PMC2919299	M01003	The chloroform phase was then dried in vacuo and stored at −80ºC until analysis.
PMC2919299	M01004	Prior to analysis, dried lipid extracts were reconstituted in 60 μL methanol and centrifuged at 13,400g for 5 min to remove any particulates.
PMC2919299	M01005	Our previous studies have indicated no significant difference in the solubility of triglycerides, cholesterol esters, or related lipids containing longer chain fatty acids when using methanol, the Bligh and Dyer solvent (chloroform/methanol/water, 1/2/0.8, v/v/v), or a commonly used solvent for shotgun (infusion) lipidomics (chloroform/methanol/water, 1/2.2/0.12, v/v/v) for reconstitution of dried plasma lipid extracts.
PMC2919299	M02002	The mobile phases were (A) 10 mM ammonium acetate in 50:50 water/methanol (v/v) and (B) 10 mM ammonium acetate in 50:50 methanol/acetonitrile (v/v).
PMC2919299	R00028	LPC: lysophosphatidylcholine; PC: phosphatidylcholine; SM: sphingomyelin; LPE: lysophosphatidylethanolamine; PE: phosphatidylethanolamine; TAG: triacylglycerol; CE: cholesterol ester; NET: normalized elution time.
PMC2951909	A02001	We quantified 17 metabolites including amino-acids, organic acids, and ketone bodies.
PMC2951909	A02002	Quantitative analysis revealed significantly lower acetate concentrations (p = 0.0002) in ALS patients compared to controls.
PMC2951909	A02003	Concentration of acetone trended higher (p = 0.015), and those of pyruvate (p = 0.002) and ascorbate (p = 0.003) were higher in the ALS group.
PMC2951909	A03001	The results indicate a perturbation of glucose metabolism, and the need to further explore cerebral energetic metabolism.
PMC2951909	D00007	Importantly, glutamate could not be detected in CSF of patients and controls by NMR technique.
PMC2951909	D00008	Fiszmann in a recent study found a glutamate concentration around 0.6–0.9 µM in control CSF and 2.6–6.1 µM in ALS CSF.
PMC2951909	D00009	Even if there may be an increase of glutamate in ALS patients, the NMR methodology is not able to pick up such very low concentrations.
PMC2951909	D00010	Univariate analysis showed higher concentrations of CSF ascorbate in ALS patients.
PMC2951909	D00011	Two previous studies have compared concentrations of ascorbate between ALS patients and controls but results were contradictory –.
PMC2951909	D00012	The elevated levels of this anti-oxidant molecule are compatible with oxidative stress previously described in ALS and could also be linked to ascorbic acid release from astrocytes after glutamate stimulation , .
PMC2951909	D00013	Glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity is a recognized factor in the pathophysiology of ALS and could result in elevated levels of ascorbic acid.
PMC2951909	D00014	Ascorbic acid might, by itself, modulate neuronal metabolism through inhibition of glucose consumption during episodes of glutamatergic synaptic activity and by stimulating lactate uptake in neurons , , observations consistent with the lower lactate/pyruvate ratio seen in our ALS patients.
PMC2951909	D00015	These findings together with data previously published on metabolic modifications suggest a perturbation of brain glucose metabolism in patients with ALS .
PMC2951909	D00016	We also noted lower CSF concentrations of acetate and a trend toward higher CSF concentrations of acetone in ALS patients.
PMC2951909	D00017	We found no differences in other ketone bodies between ALS patients and controls, but did note high interindividual variability of these parameters.
PMC2951909	D00018	Kumar et al. described higher concentrations of ketone bodies (BHBT and acetone) and acetate in the serum of ALS patients .
PMC2951909	D00021	Consequently, in addition to the usual energetic substrates (carbohydrates, lactate, fat), ketone bodies and acetate could also be used as a source of energy in the brains of ALS patients , .
PMC2951909	D00022	Thus the high levels of ketone bodies and acetate reported in serum could be due to the increased beta oxidation of fatty acids, related to higher energy needs , .
PMC2951909	D00023	Monocarboxylic acid transporters (MCT1) mediate the transport of ketone bodies and acetate from blood to brain through the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) and their influx into the brain is largely determined by the amount of ketones and acetate present in the blood , .
PMC2951909	D00024	Thus, acetate, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate may be consumed by neurones and astrocytes to provide energy.
PMC2951909	D00025	However, metabolism of acetone is different than for the other ketones, perhaps explaining the still moderately higher level of acetone in ALS patients .
PMC2951909	M00018	Standard clinical laboratory tests including bacteriological, biochemical analyses of CSF and blood glucose levels were collected for each subject.
PMC2951909	M02017	Calibration of the ERETIC peak, which had the same area in all spectra, was made using a mixture of 9.13mM of citrate, 9.20mM of lactate, and 9.10mM of glutamate as the reference tube.
PMC2951909	M02020	Because beta-methyl-L-amino-alanine (BMAA) has been recently reported by several authors as potentially involved in the etiology of ALS, we searched for its presence .
PMC2951909	R00006	There were no differences in standard bacteriological and biochemical tests of CSF, or in blood glucose levels between groups.
PMC2951909	R01000	The _1 H-NMR signals of all common metabolites including amino-acids, organic acids, and carbohydrates were assigned according to previous publications. .
PMC2951909	R01002	We found particularly no trace of BMAA in the CSF of our ALS patients.
PMC2951909	R02000	We analysed 17 CSF metabolites in ALS and non ALS patients, defined as follows: amino-acids (alanine, glutamine, tyrosine), organic acids (citrate, acetate, α-hydroxybutyrate (AHBT)), ketone bodies (β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBT), acetone, acetoacetate), glucose, fructose, metabolites involved in glucose metabolism (pyruvate, lactate, creatinine and creatine, recently identified as markers of mitochondrial dysfunction , the anti-oxidant molecule ascorbate, and formate as well as ethanol.
PMC2951909	R02003	We found significantly lower concentrations of acetate in ALS patients than in controls (53 vs 104 µmol/L, p = 0.0002).
PMC2951909	R02004	There were higher concentrations of ascorbate and pyruvate in ALS patients compared to non ALS patients (p = 0.003 and p = 0.002, respectively).
PMC2951909	R02005	The lactate/pyruvate ratio, a marker of cytosolic oxido-reduction state was lower in ALS patients than in controls (56 vs 115, p = 0.0029).
PMC2951909	R02006	Acetone concentrations trended to be higher in ALS patients (p = 0.015).
PMC2951909	R02007	Box plots representing acetate, acetone, ascorbate, and pyruvate concentrations in the ALS and non ALS groups are shown in .
PMC2951909	R02008	CSF concentrations of pyruvate (A), ascorbate (B), acetate (C) and acetone (D) are represented with median, upper and lower quartile, minimum and maximum data values.
PMC2951909	R03005	The ALS patients seemed to be characterized by high concentrations of pyruvate, ascorbate, and acetone whereas the non-ALS group seemed to be weighted by lower concentrations of these metabolites and by high concentrations of formate, acetate and β-hydroxybutyrate.
PMC2978704	A01002	Known biomarkers of diabetes could be replicated by this multiple metabolomic platform approach, including sugar metabolites (1,5-anhydroglucoitol), ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate), and branched chain amino acids.
PMC2978704	D00018	Total cholesterol and LDL were actually lower in the diabetes group, possibly a consequence of lipid lowering medication.
PMC2978704	D01000	Glucose and many related carbohydrate metabolites were readily confirmed as a diabetes biomarker.
PMC2978704	D01001	Modified hexoses such as N-acetylglucosamine, deoxyglucose and glucuronic acid were all detected at higher serum concentrations in the diabetes group, mirroring the increased supply of glucose as a precursor for their biosynthesis.
PMC2978704	D01002	The same effect is observed by elevated maltose levels.
PMC2978704	D01003	Alterations of glycolipid and glycoprotein biosynthesis and degradation could possibly lead to increased serum concentrations of complex sugars, containing N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid moieties.
PMC2978704	D01004	1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG), the 1-deoxy form of glucose is a short-term glycemic marker , .
PMC2978704	D01005	1,5-AG is currently used to monitor glycemic control in patients with diabetes and is a good positive control of this study .
PMC2978704	D01007	In agreement with these observations we found a significant decrease of average 1,5-AG concentrations in participants with diabetes when compared to the control group.
PMC2978704	D02000	The BCAAs leucine, isoleucine, and valine as well as their gamma-glutamyl-derivates are all increased in the diabetes group, indicating an impaired short-term metabolic control , i.e. peripheral tissues such as skeletal muscle may have lost their ability to react to the presence of energy sources by selective uptake mechanisms.
PMC2978704	D02004	BCAAs contribute to glucose recycling via the glucose-alanine cycle .
PMC2978704	D02005	There is a continuous flux of BCAAs from visceral tissues through the blood to skeletal muscle where transamination of the BCAAs provides the amino group for production of alanine from pyruvate with a corresponding movement of alanine from muscle to liver to support hepatic gluconeogenesis .
PMC2978704	D02006	Under normal conditions, alanine arising from BCAA nitrogen likely accounts for 25% of gluconeogenesis from amino acids .
PMC2978704	D02007	Diabetic db-/db- mice present clear evidence of increased gluconeogenesis, visible in strongly decreased concentrations of the gluconeogenic amino acids alanine, glycine, and serine .
PMC2978704	D02009	Glycine concentrations are not significantly different between the two groups; alanine and serine concentrations are even 6–10% higher in the diabetes group.
PMC2978704	D03000	It is known that the characteristic features of dyslipidemia in humans with type 2 diabetes are high plasma triglyceride concentration, low HDL cholesterol concentrations and increased concentration of small dense LDL-cholesterol particles, while total cholesterol is not increased in patients with diabetes.
PMC2978704	D03003	Association studies with blood lipid parameters [Adamski et al., unpublished data, ] show that many PC species associate with HDL and total cholesterol levels while PE species associate with triglyceride levels.
PMC2978704	D03004	In this study, we observed lower phosphatidylcholine (PC) and higher phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) concentration in the diabetes group matches the lower HDL and total cholesterol levels and higher triglyceride levels in this group, indicating that these glycerophospholipids may provide a more differentiated view of the shifted lipid homeostasis in patients with diabetes as what can be obtained from the bulk blood cholesterol and triglyceride parameters alone.
PMC2978704	D03006	observed reduced levels of multiple acylglycerophosphocholine species that were highly correlated with insulin resistance as measured by the euglycemic clamp.
PMC2978704	D04000	The two common ketones produced in humans are acetoacetic acid and β-hydroxybutyrate .
PMC2978704	D04001	Acetoacetic acid was not measured in this study.
PMC2978704	D04002	In the diabetes group we observe highly increased concentrations of the ketone 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA).
PMC2978704	D04003	At the same time, the acetate concentrations are lower, as indicated by the ratio between acetate and BHBA.
PMC2978704	D04006	Ketogenesis, the formation of ketone bodies from lipid breakdown and deamination of amino acids, occurs after depletion of the hepatic glycogen pool.
PMC2978704	D04007	In the case of diabetes, this can be related to glucose defective absorption, related to insulin deficiency.
PMC2978704	D04008	The concentrations of ketones observed here probably do not correspond to a state of diabetic ketoacidosis, but indicate that the diabetes group shows signals of mild ketosis.
PMC2978704	D04009	A similar phenotype has previously been observed in a clinical biomarker study on metabolic syndrome patients (three or more ATP criteria) where the carnitine ester of BHBA was found at significantly elevated concentrations as compared to healthy controls (Weinberger, unpublished data).
PMC2978704	D05000	3-indoxyl sulfate (IS), which is higher in the diabetes group, is metabolized by the liver from indole, which is produced from tryptophan by the intestinal flora.
PMC2978704	D05001	IS shows nephrotoxicity and is a stimulating factor for progression of chronic renal failure (CRF) , .
PMC2978704	D05002	Additional evidence for the onset of diabetic nephropathy are creatinine concentrations, which are found to be increased >16% in the diabetes group.
PMC2978704	D05003	Creatinine is produced in muscle and is often increased in diabetic nephropathy.
PMC2978704	D05004	Assuming that higher creatinine and IS values are indicators for impaired renal function, these findings are in agreement with previous work that shows that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is the rate-limiting factor for renal clearance of cysteine in patients with diabetes but without overt nephropathy, and that hyperfiltration explains lower than normal mean plasma total cysteine concentrations in patients with diabetes .
PMC2978704	D05005	Moreover, another study suggests that an observed increase of plasma homocysteine concentration with age could be partly due to the deterioration of renal function.
PMC2978704	D05006	Our results suggest that the cysteine to creatinine and the cysteine to IS ratios are indicators of deterioration of renal function in diabetes patients and support the idea that endogenous amino acid catabolites, such as IS, may play a significant role in the progression of chronic renal failure.
PMC2978704	D05007	Furthermore, phenylacetate was more often detected in the diabetes group in this study.
PMC2978704	D05008	Phenylacetate is a carboxylic acid ester that has been found in the biofluids of patients with nephritis .
PMC2978704	D05010	These findings now need to be further verified by a quantitative analysis from retrospective studies, especially in the light of recent findings that L-cystine stone prevention by rational design of crystal growth inhibitors may be possible .
PMC2978704	D06000	In our study salicyluric glucuronide was more frequently detected in subjects with diabetes.
PMC2978704	D06001	Salicyluric glucuronide is the product of the hydrolysis of acetylsalicylic acid in liver, blood and some other organs.
PMC2978704	D06002	Detection of increased levels of this drug metabolite is plausible considering subjects with diabetes more frequently use drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid due to their high risk for cardiovascular complications .
PMC2978704	D06003	Furthermore, both pioglitazone and hydroxypioglitazone were detected in individuals with diabetes only, confirming the intake of diabetes-specific medication.
PMC2978704	D06004	In addition, the association with erythritol could indicate a more frequent use of sweetener by patients with diabetes.
PMC2978704	D07000	Cholate was detected more frequently in the control group than in the diabetes group, while the opposite was true for deoxycholate.
PMC2978704	D07001	Along with chenodeoxycholic acid, cholic acid is one of two primary bile acids produced exclusively in the liver where it is synthesized from cholesterol.
PMC2978704	D07002	Deoxycholate, also known as cholanoic acid (3α,12α-dihydroxy-5β-cholanate), is one of the secondary bile acids and constitutes a significant part of the circulating BA pool in humans (35%).
PMC2978704	D07004	The fecal loss of BAs, which is compensated for by de novo BA biosynthesis in the liver to maintain pool size, represents a major route for cholesterol turnover.
PMC2978704	M03008	For the present study, a subset of the available analytical methods was selected: 201 metabolites covering the compound classes amino acids, biogenic amines and polyamines, reducing mono- and oliogosaccharides, glycerophospho- and sphingolipids, eicosanoids and other oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids were detected and quantified.
PMC2978704	M03011	Concentrations of all analyzed metabolites are reported in µM (except for eicosanoid concentrations which are reported in nM units in the supplementary data files).
PMC2978704	M03020	Altogether, 24 metabolites were identified in the EDTA plasma samples, including alcohols, amides, amines, amino acid derivatives, amino acids, aromatic compounds, fatty acids, food/drug components, organic acids and sugars.

PMC2978704	M04001	For the present study, a subset of the available analytical methods was selected: 201 metabolites covering the compound classes amino acids, biogenic amines and polyamines, reducing mono- and oliogosaccharides, glycerophospho- and sphingolipids, eicosanoids and other oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids were detected and quantified.

PMC2978704	M05006	Altogether, 24 metabolites were identified in the EDTA plasma samples, including alcohols, amides, amines, amino acid derivatives, amino acids, aromatic compounds, fatty acids, food/drug components, organic acids and sugars.
PMC2978704	M06008	The Metabolon platform has, among other studies, been successfully applied in the analysis of the adult human plasma metabolome identification of sarcosine as a biomarker for prostate cancer , and biomarkers of insulin resistance in a nondiabetic population .
PMC2978704	M08001	However, in order to test for potentially confounding factors, we analyzed the impact of the following diabetes-related treatments on our results: lipid-lowering medication (excluding plant based), blood pressure lowering medication, antidiabetic medication (insulin or oral), statin treatment, insulin therapy, oral antidiabetic medication, calcium antagonists, beta blockers, diuretics, and ACE inhibitors.
PMC2978704	R00007	Note that the metabolites metabolites that are quantified uniquely on the Biocrates platform carry specific information on the lipid side-chain composition of the different phospholipid classes (sometimes also referred to as lipidomics).
PMC2978704	R01006	Concentrations of glucose, mannose, desoxyhexose (primarily deoxyglucose), uronic acid (primarily glucuronic acid), dihexose (primarily maltose), and several products from the biosynthesis or the degradation of glycosylated proteins or glycolipids (H3-HNAc2-NANA, HNAC, HNAc-H2-dH) are all found increased by up to 90% in the diabetes group (p = 1.3×10_−4 to 2.5×10_−9 ).
PMC2978704	R01007	Furthermore, there is a significant decrease of average 1,5-anhydroglucitol concentrations by 37.8% (p = 5.1×10_−6 ) in participants with diabetes when compared to the control group.
PMC2978704	R01008	Lower 1,5-AG concentrations at higher glucose levels in participants with diabetes when compared to the control group display the current role of 1,5-AG as a marker for glycemic control in patients with diabetes.
PMC2978704	R01009	Among the numerous glycerophospholipids that are determined on the Biocrates platform, the phosphatidylcholines PC_aa_C34:4 (p = 6.5×10_−4 ) and the lyso-phosphocholine PC_a_20:4 (p = 1.4×10_−3 ) display marked negative associations with diabetes, followed by many other PC-species with poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in their lipid side chains, although with lower, but still significant strengths of association (PC_ae_C40:1, PC_ae_C36:3, PC_ae_C38:5, …; see ).
PMC2978704	R01010	On the other hand, phosphatidylethanolamines with similar lipid side chain compositions (PE_aa_C34:2, PE_aa_C36:2, PE_aa_C38:4, …) display an increase in the diabetes group.
PMC2978704	R01011	For example, statistically significant associations (p = 2.6−8.3×10_−5 ) are observed in particular when ratios with beta-hydroxyisovalerate are considered.
PMC2978704	R01012	Concentrations of medium-chain length fatty acids and arachidonate are on average lower in the diabetes group, while other long chain fatty acids are higher, including a number of PUFAs, such as the essential fatty acids linolate and linolenate.
PMC2978704	R01013	Note in particular that arachidonate is incorporated into the lipid side chains of the above mentioned (lyso)phosphatidylcholines PC_aa_C34:4 and PC_a_20:4.
PMC2978704	R01014	The branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine as well as their gamma-glutamyl-derivates are all increased in the diabetes group.
PMC2978704	R01015	We observe highly increased concentrations of the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) in the diabetes group (+53.9% when measured on a MS platform, +40.6% on the NMR platform).
PMC2978704	R01016	At the same time, the acetate concentrations are lower, as indicated by the ratio between acetate and BHBA (p = 1.1×10_−4 ).
PMC2978704	R01017	Association with acetate alone was not significant.
PMC2978704	R01018	3-indoxyl sulfate (IS) concentrations are on average 42.8% higher in the diabetes group (p = 1.7×10_−4 ).
PMC2978704	R01019	Additionally, creatinine concentrations are found to be increased by over 16% in the diabetes group.
PMC2978704	R01020	The association of the cysteine to creatinine ratio with diabetes (p = 1.1×10_−6 ) increases by a factor of 289.5 when compared to the association of the single metabolites alone, with cysteine concentrations found decreased in the diabetes group and creatinine values increased.
PMC2978704	R01021	Similarly, the association of ratios between cysteine and IS (p = 6.8×10_−7 ) increases by a factor of 242.7.
PMC2978704	R01023	Salicyluric glucuronide was detected in 16 of 40 subjects with diabetes and in 8 of 60 controls (two-sided exact Fisher test: p = 0.0037).
PMC2978704	R01024	In three patients with diabetes, both pioglitazone and hydroxypioglitazone were detected, confirming the intake of diabetes-specific medication; whereas none were observed in the control group.
PMC2978704	R01025	Erythritol, a naturally-derived sugar substitute, was found to be associated with diabetes in ratios with cysteine.
PMC2978704	R01026	Phenylacetate was detected in 29 of 40 participants with diabetes and only in 31 of 60 controls (p = 0.041).
PMC2978704	R01027	Finally, kynurenine levels are found to be 14.6%–21.8% higher in the diabetes group.
PMC2978704	R01028	The bile acid cholate was detected in only 28 of 40 subjects with diabetes and in 53 of 60 controls (two-sided p = 0.036).
PMC2978704	R01029	Deoxycholate was found in 27 of 40 persons with diabetes and only in 27 of 60 controls (p = 0.040).
PMC2978704	R01030	Gamma-muricholate (hyocholic acid) was detected in only 4 of 40 patients with diabetes and in 16 of 60 controls (p = 0.045).
PMC2978704	R01033	However, mentioning this marginal association here is noteworthy since fibrinogen is a blood-borne glycoprotein.
PMC3024392	A00007	All DCM patients, with or without LMNA mutation, differed from controls in regard to distinct serum lipidomic profile dominated by diminished odd-chain triglycerides and lipid ratios related to desaturation.
PMC3024392	D00002	Diminishment of odd-chain triglyceride in LMNA carriers was associated with increased end-diastolic wall thickness in left ventricle but the meaning of this finding is unclear.
PMC3024392	D00006	Among the affected lipids, the diminished odd-chain triglycerides are of particular interest as they were also diminished in DCM independent of LMNA mutation and thus could be considered as DCM risk marker candidates but this warrants further studies.
PMC3024392	D00007	Odd-chain triglycerides have been previously associated with mitochondrial fat oxidation disorders and their dietary supplementation has led to promising results in the treatment of chronic cardiomyopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and muscle weakness .
PMC3024392	D00010	Given the experimental setting of our study, the diet itself is an unlikely factor behind the observed diminishment of odd-chain triglycerides in the DCM groups.
PMC3024392	D00011	Instead, the altered absorption of lipids or formation of triglycerides from fatty acids in enterocytes are more plausible factors.
PMC3024392	D00022	In conclusion, using a novel integrative approach by combining serum lipidomics and MR imaging in LMNA mutation carriers at risk of DCM, we have shown that specific lipid abnormalities such as diminished odd-chain triglycerides precede DCM.
PMC3024392	D00023	Our findings should be considered preliminary and the possible role of odd-chain triglycerides in the development or prevention of DCM warrant further investigations.
PMC3024392	M01003	Cine MRI was performed with a 1.5 T system (Sonata, Siemens Medical Solution) and a body array coil.
PMC3024392	M03001	In brief, serum samples (10 µl) diluted with 0.15 M NaCl (10 µl) and spiked with a standard mixture containing 10 lipid species were extracted with a mixture of chloroform and methanol 2∶1 (100 µl).
PMC3024392	M03005	The solvent system included water (1% 1 M ammonium acetate, 0.1% HCOOH) and a mixture of acetonitrile and 2-propanol (5∶2, 1% 1 M NH_4 Ac, 0.1% HCOOH).
PMC3024392	M03009	Calibration was performed as follows: all monoacyl lipids except cholesterol esters, such as monoacylglycerols and monoacyl-glycerophospholipids, were calibrated with lysophosphatidylcholine PC(17∶0/0∶0)
PMC3024392	M03011	All diacyl lipids except phosphatidylethanolamines were calibrated with phosphatidylcholine PC(17∶0/17∶0)
PMC3024392	M03012	(Avanti Polar Lipids), the phosphatidylethanolamines with PE(17∶0/17∶0) (Avanti Polar Lipids) and the triglycerides and cholesterol esters with triglyceride TG(17∶0/17∶0/17∶0)
PMC3024392	R01001	Comparison of profiles of LMNA carriers (Group 1) and their controls (Group 2) revealed differences dominated by several phosphatidylethanolamines, with the direction of change depending on the fatty acid composition, as well as by diminished odd-chain triglycerides and lipid ratios related to desaturation (i.e. , increase of double bonds).
PMC3024392	R01008	The final model included only one variable, the odd-chain triglyceride TG(49∶3).
PMC3024392	R01012	Negative parameter estimate indicates that the risk of DCM increases with lowering concentrations of TG(49∶3).
PMC3024392	R01014	Lower levels of TG(49∶3) do not depend on the lamin mutation (panel D) but are DCM specific (panel E).
PMC3024392	R02024	 shows the sensitivity of the heart model to change in TG(49∶3) concentration, i.e. a lipid found diminished in LMNA mutation carriers as well as in DCM ( and ).
PMC3024392	R02031	The blue color indicates the regions where the wall thickening/motion decreased when the TG(49∶3) value was decreased.
PMC3024392	R02032	Therefore, the decreased function in these regions is associated with the LMNA-related TG(49∶3) concentration change.
PMC3024392	R02033	Respectively, red color indicates the regions that showed increased wall thickening/motion related to the TG(49∶3) concentration decrease in LMNA mutation.
PMC3064259	A00001	Benzo[a ]pyrene (BaP) is a prototypic carcinogenic PAH, which requires metabolic activation to elicit its detrimental effects.
PMC3064259	A00002	The major end product of its diol epoxide metabolic activation pathway is r -7,t -8,9,c -10-tetrahydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a ]pyrene (trans, anti -BaPT).
PMC3064259	A00012	trans, anti -BaPT was readily detected in all urine samples analyzed including 30 smokers (0.71 ± 0.64 fmol/mg creatinine) and 30 non-smokers (0.34 ± 0.2 fmol/mg creatinine)
PMC3064259	D00005	A potentially significant advantage of this method is that it measures exposure plus metabolic activation of BaP, and therefore may be related to cancer risk.
PMC3064259	D00006	A major challenge for quantitation of BaP metabolites in human urine is that their levels are extremely low compared to those of smaller PAH such as phenanthrene.
PMC3064259	D00007	The urinary levels of trans, anti -BaPT are, for example, approximately 10,000 times lower than those of the corresponding metabolite of phenanthrene, r -1,t -2,3-c -4-tetrahydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrophenanthrene (trans, anti -PheT), which we have previously quantified in the urine of smokers (,).
PMC3064259	D00009	The level of BaP in mainstream cigarette smoke is about 30 times lower than that of phenanthrene (5–10 ng vs. 150–300 ng/cigarette) (,).
PMC3064259	D00010	BaP metabolites are mainly excreted in feces while phenanthrene metabolites are excreted mainly in urine, based on studies in laboratory animals (–).
PMC3064259	D00011	Metabolism of phenanthrene to trans, anti -PheT may exceed metabolism of BaP to trans, anti -BaPT, but further studies are required on this point.
PMC3064259	D00012	Only a few studies have previously described methods for the analysis of BaP metabolites in human urine.
PMC3064259	D00013	3-Hydroxy BaP was quantified as a biomarker of exposure in industrial workers (,).
PMC3064259	D00021	In addition, the urinary trans, anti -BaPT level in smokers we reported here (mean 0.64 fmol/mL urine, or 0.71 fmol/mg creatinine, n = 30) is quite consistent with our previous data for the samples in which quantitation was possible (mean 0.5 fmol/mL urine, n = 9).
PMC3064259	D00022	Our results clearly demonstrate, apparently for the first time, that cigarette smokers have significantly higher levels of trans, anti -BaPT, the end-product of the carcinogenic diol epoxide metabolic activation pathway of BaP, in their urine than do non-smokers.
PMC3064259	D00023	Besides higher BaP exposure in smokers from cigarettes (5–10 ng/cigarette, and mean = 19 cigarettes per day per person, in this study) (,), this difference may also result from the induction of P450s 1A1, 1A2, and 1B1, known to occur in smokers, as these enzymes are involved in producing trans, anti -BaPT.
PMC3064259	D00024	Non-smokers are exposed to BaP probably from polluted air and food.
PMC3064259	D00026	This is quite consistent with previous results comparing urinary metabolites from two other PAH components - pyrene and phenanthrene -between smokers and nonsmokers.
PMC3064259	D00027	Levels of 1-hydroxypyrene, a urinary metabolite of pyrene, are about twice as high in smokers' urine as in non-smokers urine, in most studies (,,).
PMC3064259	D00030	One enantiomer of this tetraol would be expected to arise from hydrolysis of BPDE, based on known stereoselectivity in the metabolic formation of BPDE, as illustrated in and summarized previously.
PMC3064259	D00031	The opposite enantiomer would be expected from hydrolysis of the reverse diol epoxide, BaP-(9S,10R )-diol-(7R,8S )-epoxide.
PMC3064259	D00033	We have previously shown that, in the urine of creosote workers exposed to relatively high levels of BaP, 78% of trans, anti -BaPT results from hydrolysis of BPDE.
PMC3064259	D00035	Measurement of BPDE-DNA adducts in humans may be a more direct approach to examine BaP metabolic activation than that described here.
PMC3064259	D00041	Futhermore, cigarette smoke contains multiple carcinogens of other types such as tobacco-specific nitrosamines and volatile organic compounds that most likely contribute to lung cancer in smokers.
PMC3064259	D00045	Average levels of this metabolite were 0.34 fmol/mg creatinine in non-smokers, and 0.71 fmol/mg creatinine in smokers.
PMC3064259	M00000	All BaP metabolites used in this study were racemic.
PMC3064259	M00001	r -7,t -8,9,c -10-tetrahydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a ]pyrene (trans, anti -BaPT), r -7,t -8,9,10-tetrahydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a ]pyrene (cis, anti -BaPT), r -7,t -8,,c -9,10-tetrahydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a ]pyrene (cis, syn -BaPT), r -7,t -8,c -9,t -10-tetrahydroxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a ]pyrene (trans, syn -BaPT), trans -4,5-dihydro-4,5-dihydroxybenzo[a ]pyrene (BaP-4,5-diol), trans -7,8-dihydro-7,8-dihydroxybenzo[a ]pyrene (BaP-7,8-diol) and trans -9,10-dihydro-9,10-dihydroxybenzo[a ]pyrene (BaP-9,10-diol) were obtained from the National Cancer Institute Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standard Repository, Midwest Research Institute (Kansas City, MO).
PMC3064259	M01002	Current smoking status was confirmed by CO and cotinine levels.
PMC3064259	M02000	The creatinine content in urine was determined at the University of Minnesota Medical Center, Fairview, Diagnostic Laboratories, using Vitros CREA slides.

PMC3064259	M04007	The NICI-MS/MS conditions were as follows: CI gas, methane at 2.0 mL/min; source temperature, 200 °C; emission current, 500 µA. Selected reaction monitoring (SRM) with a collision energy of 18 eV, electron energy of −150 eV, and Ar collision gas pressure of 1.0 mTorr was used to detect trans, anti -BaPT-tetratrimethylsilyl ether (trans, anti -BaPT-TMS) and [_13 C_6 ]trans, anti -BaPT-TMS at m/z 446 → m/z 255 and m/z 452 → m/z 261, respectively.
PMC3064259	M05001	Hepatocytes (approximately 0.12 mg protein per well) were incubated with 10 µM of BaP-4,5-diol, BaP-7,8-diol or BaP-9,10-diol, or H_2 O as a control.

PMC3064259	R00026	As multiple tetraols could be formed from BaP, we sought further confirmation of the identity of trans, anti -BaPT.
PMC3064259	R00027	Incubation of primary human hepatocytes with BaP-7,8-diol produced four isomers of BaPT, as summarized in .
PMC3064259	R00030	Incubation of BaP-9,10-diol with human hepatocytes produced two tetraols which co-eluted with standards – trans, syn -BaPT and trans, anti -BaPT.
PMC3064259	R00031	There were also two minor products which did not co-elute with cis , anti -BaPT and cis, syn -BaPT, which was expected since the 9,10-hydroxyl groups in these compounds are cis -, not trans - as in BaP-9,10-diol.
PMC3064259	R00032	The two minor products probably resulted from cis - ring opening of the syn - and anti -9,10-diol-7,8-epoxides, but this was not pursued.
PMC3064259	R00033	A small peak at the same retention time as trans, anti -BaPT was also observed in the incubations of BaP-4,5-diol with human hepatocytes, but the yield of this product was at least 10,000 times lower than those from the two other diols.
PMC3064259	R00048	The mean level of trans, anti -BaPT (0.71 ± 0.64 fmol/mg creatinine, n = 30) in the urine of smokers was significantly higher (P = 0.0018) than that in non-smokers (0.34 ± 0.20 fmol/mg creatinine, n = 30).
PMC3090613	D00001	We observed that N-acetyl-aspartate (at 2.02 ppm) appeared to be a specific metabolic signature for serous carcinoma, while N-acetyl-lysine (at 2.04 ppm) is a potential signature for mucinous carcinoma.
PMC3090613	D00002	In the endometrioid carcinoma cases and in the normal ovarian tissues, we did not observe either N-acetyl-aspartate or N-acetyl-lysine.
PMC3090613	D00004	The proximity of these two resonance and the –CH_3 moiety of sialic acid or N-acetyl groups of glycoproteins (2.06 to 2.1 ppm) may potentially lead to some confusion in vivo   _1 H-MR spectroscopy [, , , ] or non-HRMAS_5 ex vivo NMR studies of ovarian carcinoma cases.
PMC3090613	D00005	N-acetyl-aspartate is exclusively synthesized at high concentrations in the cytoplasm of neurons and was detected in a few other tissues, as well as in peritoneal mast cells, retina, and lens of the eye.
PMC3090613	D00006	The role of N-acetyl-aspartate in the solid part or in cyst fluid of ovarian serous carcinomas and the other N-acetylated molecules resonating between 2.04 and 2.07 ppm in other cancers [, –] remains obscure.
PMC3090613	D00007	 β -glucose was absent in all cases of serous cancer tissues.
PMC3090613	D00009	The absence of β -glucose is explained by the high-energy expenditure in cancer cells and elevated glucose turnover.
PMC3090613	D00011	In agreement with the literature, we also observed high levels of alanine and lactate in serous carcinoma indicating an impairment of the aerobic pathway, as well as elevated levels of glutamate, threonine (the principal amino acid of mucin), and lysine due to increased protein synthesis [, ].
PMC3090613	D00012	In contrast to many other cancers [, , , ] and in agreement with gastric or prostate cancers, the level of taurine was decreased in serous and mucinous ovarian carcinomas.
PMC3090613	D00013	This taurine deficiency may be associated with the loss of its protective role in cells, specifically in membrane stabilization as well as antioxidation and detoxification activities.
PMC3090613	D00014	An increase of the total choline-containing compounds (e.g., glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, and choline) has been reported as the most common feature in a large variety of tumors demonstrating biosynthetic and/or catabolic phosphatidylcholine-cycle pathways of cell membrane turnover [, ] and was proposed as fingerprints of tumor progression and/or as endpoints of therapeutic treatment [, –, ].
PMC3090613	D00017	In our case, we observed a significant higher level of total choline-containing compounds in all ovarian carcinomas, the free choline being more pronounced in endometrial carcinomas and phosphocholine/glycerophosphocholine in mucinous and serous carcinomas.

PMC3175039	M03011	Polymers were disintegrated; the template and non-reacted substrates were extracted with a methanol and acetic acid mixture (96:4% v/v ) in a Soxhlet apparatus over 24 h, because ASE did not fully remove the template.
PMC3175039	M03014	The SEM microscopic technique confirmed that the application of acetonitrile gave rise to a higher number of specific interactions between CDHB template and monomers (1-ALPP), resulting in compact and more porous morphology of the imprinted polymers.

PMC3206149	D00000	Metabolomic analysis of intermediate stage hepatocellular carcinoma using plasma and employing UPLC-ESI-QTOFMS based metabolomic protocols and random forests machine learning algorithm (, ) was employed for the identification of metabolic intermediates in plasma that are altered in HCC These studies were augmented by metabolite profiling for LPC and LPA by UPLC-ESI-TQMS and fatty acids by GCMS.
PMC3206149	D00009	There were six main findings of this study in relation to HCC versus controls, (1) that two bile acid conjugates and two fetal bile acids were elevated, (2) that bilirubin and biliverdin were elevated, (3) that 11 lysophospholipids were attenuated, (4) that two very long-chain fatty acids were attenuated, (5) that LPA(16:0) was considerably elevated in 4/20 HCC patients, and (6) that in the HCC group as a whole LPA(16:0) was strongly correlated with plasma AFP concentration.
PMC3206149	D00010	Regarding bile acid homeostasis, an early study recognized that fasting serum glycocholate concentrations were elevated in most patients with liver disease, but especially in LC (97.1% of cases) and HCC (94.7%).

PMC3206149	D00014	The largest number of molecules of interest that were altered in the plasma of HCC patients were in the phospholipid group of lysophosphocholines.
PMC3206149	D00018	LPCs are metabolized by phospholipase D, generating lysophosphatidic acids (LPAs), potent mitogens that act through LPA1-5 receptors.
PMC3206149	D00019	LPA are also produced from LPC extracellularly by lysophospholipase D (LPD) first described in rat plasma and that converted polyunsaturated LPC to their saturated LPA counterparts.

PMC3206149	R06015	The most interesting finding to emerge from the fatty acid profiling of HCC and control plasma was the highly statistically significant quenching of the two VLCFAs lignoceric acid (24:0) and nervonic acid (24:1).
PMC3206149	R06016	These very low levels in plasma may be due to enhanced peroxisomal β-oxidation of VLCFAs under the control of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and as a result of enhanced lignoceryl-CoA ligase activity or as a result of activation of liver X receptor α (LXRα).

PMC3206149	R12000	If PPARα is activated specifically in the livers of HCC patients relative to LC patients and healthy volunteers (HV), one would expect to observe in those former patients a decline in plasma uric acid, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, and perhaps total cholesterol, accompanied by a rise in HDL cholesterol.
PMC3206149	R12002	It is therefore likely that, if PPARα plays a role in these HCC cases, it does so very specifically, for example, by upregulating peroxisomal lignoceryl-CoA ligase activity.
PMC3206149	R13004	In addition, bilirubin was found to be elevated in HCC compared to AML and LC and biliverdin in HCC compared to LC only.
PMC3206149	R13005	The most obvious change in small plasma molecules was displayed by the two fatty acids lignoceric acid (24:0) and nervonic acid (24:1), which were virtually extinguished in both HCC and AML.
PMC3257420	A00000	In vitro studies have found that flavanol epigallocatechin (EGC) and flavonols, but not flavanol epicatechin (EC), activate glutathione s-transferases (GST), a family of phase II enzymes that detoxify reactive oxygen species, such as catechol estrogen metabolites.
PMC3257420	A01001	Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure urinary excretion of flavanols and flavonols.
PMC3257420	A02000	Urinary excretion of flavonols and flavanols, particularly EGC (p=0.02), was significantly higher among women null for GSTM1 than those positive for GSTM1 .
PMC3257420	A02001	Flavonols and flavanols (EGC in particular) were associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer among those null for GSTM1 and GSTT1, with a p-value of 0.04 for the interaction between EGC and GSTM1 polymorphism.
PMC3257420	A02002	In contrast, among women possessing both GSTM1 and GSTT1, breast cancer risk increased with levels of flavonols, particularly kaempferol.
PMC3257420	A04000	tea polyphenols, flavonol, flavanol, genomic polymorphism, interaction
PMC3257420	D00004	Similarly, we recently reported that there was no overall significant association between urinary flavonols and flavanols and breast cancer risk.
PMC3257420	D00005	In the current nested case-control study, we found significantly higher urinary excretion of flavonols and EGC among healthy women carrying the GSTM1 null genotype than those positive for GSTM1 .
PMC3257420	D00006	Furthermore, we found that breast cancer risk associated with urinary excretion of EGC and flavonols may be modified by GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphism.
PMC3257420	D00007	Among women carrying the null genotype for both GSTM1 and GSTT1, breast cancer risk was reduced with increased levels of flavonols and EGC.
PMC3257420	D00008	Among women possessing at least one copy of both GSTM1 and GSTT1, flavonols, particularly kaempferol, were significantly associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.
PMC3257420	D00009	Our finding that GST polymorphisms may modify the associations of flavonols and EGC with breast cancer may provide a possible interpretation for the inconsistent results on green tea drinking, a major source of EGC and flavonols, and breast cancer risk in previous cohort studies [,,].
PMC3257420	D00010	We found that the inverse association between urinary flavonols and EGC and breast cancer risk only appeared among those null for GSTM1, particularly null for both GSTM1 and GSTT1 .
PMC3257420	D00011	This finding is very similar to that for another phytochemical, isothiocyanates.
PMC3257420	D00012	In three previous studies, the inverse association between urinary isothiocyanates and cancer of lung, breast and colorectum was only observed among those null for GSTM1 and GSTT1 [–].
PMC3257420	D00013	One possible explanation is that for those null for both GSTM1 and GSTT1 , the EGC and isothiocyanates can activate other forms of GSTs, such as GSTP and GSTA.
PMC3257420	D00014	Isothiocyanates, as well as catechol estrogens, are substrates of GST enzymes.
PMC3257420	D00015	EGC and flavanols are a special family of polyphenols, structurally similar to catechol estrogens.
PMC3257420	D00016	Thus, it is conceivable that catechol polyphenols are substrates of GSTs as well.
PMC3257420	D00017	As a result, among those present for GSTM1 and GSTT1 , catechol polyphenols may be more rapidly excreted in urine through conjugation with glutathione (GSH), leading to a lower bioavailable level of cancer-inhibitory tea polyphenols.
PMC3257420	D00018	This possibility is supported by our finding that healthy women with GSTM1 null genotype had higher urine levels of both flavonols and flavanol EGC than those with at least one copy of GSTM1.
PMC3257420	D00019	Furthermore, previous in vitro studies showed that flavanol EC did not affect activity of GST enzymes [,], which provides biologic support for why we did not find a significant interaction between EC and GST polymorphisms.
PMC3257420	D00022	This finding indicates that loss of GSTM1 function may lead to increased levels of isothiocyanates which induces expression of GST-alpha, while GST-alpha in turn possesses much less activity to degrade isothiocyanates than GSTM1.
PMC3257420	D00034	However, this is unlikely because the findings are not only supported by in vitro studies, but are consistent with the fact that urinary levels of flavonols and EGC differ by GST genotypes among controls in the current study, and in studies of isothiocyanates which also interact with GST polymorphisms.
PMC3257420	M00009	For 87.7% of the cohort participants, a spot urine sample was collected into a sterilized 100-mlcup containing 125 mg of ascorbic acid.
PMC3257420	M02000	For 87.7% of the cohort participants, a spot urine sample was collected into a sterilized 100-mlcup containing 125 mg of ascorbic acid.
PMC3257420	M04002	Final results were presented after adjusting for creatinine concentrations (ng/mg creatinine).
PMC3257420	M06004	Potential confounding factors included in final regression models were age, education, age at menarche, age at first live birth, months of breastfeeding, body mass index, menopausal status, history of breast fibroadenoma, first-degree family cancer history, smoking status, total intake of red meat and isoflavones, and use of hormone replacement therapy.
PMC3257420	M06006	For example, urinary levels of flavanols and flavonols other than quercetin were additionally adjusted for in the analysis for urinary quercetin.
PMC3257420	R00004	Controls were more likely to smoke cigarettes, breastfeed longer, and have a higher intake of red meat and soy isoflavones compared with cases.
PMC3257420	R00009	Comparison of breast cancer cases and controls by selected baseline demographic and risk factors, a nested case-control study within the Shanghai Women’s Health Study (SWHS), 1997–2006 We compared the urinary excretion rates of flavonols and flavanols by GSTM1 and GSTT1 genotypes among controls.
PMC3257420	R00010	Since EGC and EC may have different activities on GSTs, we have not conducted analysis on total flavanols (EGC + EC).
PMC3257420	R00011	Excretion rates of all polyphenols were elevated among women with the GSTM1 null genotype compared to those with at least one copy of GSTM1, although the results were only significant for EGC (p=0.02) and of borderline significance for flavonols (K +Q) (p=0.08), even after adjusting for age and amount of green tea consumption.
PMC3257420	R00012	On the other hand, we did not find a significant difference by GSTT1 genotype, although the urinary level of EGC was higher among women with the GSTT1 null genotype than those with at least one copy of GSTT1.
PMC3257420	R00014	We evaluated the association between urinary flavonols and flavanols and risk of breast cancer by the GSTM1 genotype.
PMC3257420	R00015	Consistent with results observed in , urinary excretion of EGC, but not EC, significantly interacted with GSTM1 genotype (P for interaction, 0.04).
PMC3257420	R00016	Among those with the GSTM1 null genotype, increased urinary excretion of EGC was associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer, with ORs (95% CI) of 0.66 (0.41–1.05) and 0.64 (0.41–1.01) for the middle and highest tertile of excretion levels, respectively, compared to women in the lowest tertile of EGC (p for trend, 0.058).
PMC3257420	R00017	Conversely, among women with one or two copies of GSTM1 , EGC was positively associated with the risk of breast cancer (p for trend, 0.10).
PMC3257420	R00018	Similarly, urinary excretion of flavonols, particularly kaempferol, also was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer among those with at least one copy of GSTM1 (P for trend, 0.05).
PMC3257420	R00019	Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk of breast cancer associated with urinary excretion rate of polyphenols stratified by GSTM1 polymorphism, a nested case-control study within the Shanghai Women’s Health Study (SWHS), 1997–2006 We did not find any significant interactions between urinary flavonols or flavanols and GSTT1 genotype in relation to breast cancer risk.
PMC3257420	R00020	However, similar to patterns of associations observed for GSTM1 , breast cancer risk also increased with levels of flavonols, particularly kaempferol, among women with at least one copy of GSTT1 (p for trend=0.04 for flavonols and p for trend=0.05 for kaempferol).
PMC3257420	R00021	Further, we found that urinary excretion of EGC (p for interaction, P<0.01) and flavonols (p for interaction, 0.03) significantly interacted with joint genotypes of GSTM1 and GSTT1 in relation to breast cancer.
PMC3257420	R00022	Among women null for both GSTM1 and GSTT1, breast cancer risk decreased with increasing levels of flavonols (p for trend, 0.03), with OR of 0.49 (0.25–0.93) among those in the highest tertile of flavonols.
PMC3257420	R00023	Conversely, among those with at least one copy for both GSTM1 and GSTT1 , breast cancer risk rose with increasing levels of urinary flavonols, primarily kaempferol (p for trend, 0.04).
PMC3257420	R00024	Breast cancer risk for women in the highest tertile of kaempferol have more than doubled (OR=2.41 (1.04–5.59) that for women in the lowest tertile(data not shown).
PMC3279728	A00002	The sample consisted of a depressed group of patients with heart failure enrolled in an NIMH-supported clinical trial of sertraline versus placebo in depressed heart failure patients, and a non-depressed comparator group of heart failure patients.
PMC3279728	D00002	These findings build on a previous report by our group that identified between-group differences in several fatty acids, glycerol and gamma-aminobutyric acid.
PMC3279728	D00004	Glutamate and aspartate, two amino acids detected in this study, are considered to be the main excitatory amino acids in the central nervous system._,  
PMC3279728	D00005	Additionally, glutamate, aspartate and serine play an important role with N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors.
PMC3279728	D00006	NMDA receptors are non-specific cation channel receptors which act by mediating fast-synaptic transmission in the brain and are fundamental to memory and behavior.
PMC3279728	D00007	Activation of the NMDA receptor can be initiated by the binding of the amino acid glutamate and aspartate.
PMC3279728	D00008	NMDA receptors also require the additional binding of glycine or serine as a co-agonist for functional opening of the ion channel.
PMC3279728	D00009	Within this study, aspartate and serine were significantly elevated in depressed subjects when compared with controls.
PMC3279728	D00010	Glutamate was initially identified as having a significantly elevated level within depressed subjects; however, ANCOVA analysis later indicated that there was a significant age effect associated with glutamate.
PMC3279728	D00011	It should be noted that once accounting for age, the group effect was no longer significant for glutamate.
PMC3279728	D00013	Several studies have identified elevated levels of glutamate and aspartate in serum samples from depressed subjects in relation to non-depressed controls.
PMC3279728	D00015	Higher levels of the branch-chain amino acids (BCAA) leucine and isoleucine were also detected within the depressed subjects in relation to the control group.
PMC3279728	D00016	BCAAs are involved with systemic stress responses, they are regulators of protein synthesis and degradation, and they serve as key precursors for glutamine and alanine synthesis.
PMC3279728	D00017	In particular, leucine plays a key role in several key brain metabolic functions, including serving as a precursor of fuel molecules, alpha-ketoisocaproate and ketone bodies, and as a regulator of the activity of some enzymes important for brain energy metabolism.
PMC3279728	D00018	Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid and serves as a precursor for the amino acid tyrosine as well as for catecholamines in the body (tyramine, dopamine, epinephrine and norepinephrine).
PMC3279728	D00019	In this study, the levels of phenylalanine were found to be slightly but significantly higher in depressed subjects in relation to controls.
PMC3279728	D00023	Glutathione (GSH) is a tripeptide (L-γ-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine) that is synthesized in the cytosol from the precursor amino acids glutamate, cysteine and glycine.
PMC3279728	D00024	GSH is the most abundant redox molecule and is critical in maintaining redox status in cells.
PMC3279728	D00026	However, glutathione (reduced or oxidized) was not detected in samples for this study and pyroglutamate (5-oxoproline), which is also an indication of glutathione biosynthesis flux and oxidative stress, failed to show any significant difference between depressed and non-depressed subjects.
PMC3279728	D00029	For example, ω-oxidation of fatty acids is known to occur in liver microsomes through a NADPH- and cytochrome P450-dependent process by which the omega carbon of a fatty acid is oxidized to an alcohol then to a carboxylic acid, thereby generating a dicarboxylic acid (DCA).
PMC3279728	D00034	These include an increase in the levels of azelate, suberate, sebacate and 3-hydroxysebacate.
PMC3279728	D00036	With regard to other fatty acids, we found depressed heart failure patients had lower concentrations of fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared with non-depressed patients but the differences were not different statistically.
PMC3279728	D00038	In addition to this, we also found decreased level of the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate in depressed subjects in comparison with controls.
PMC3279728	D00039	Ketone bodies are generated from acetyl-CoA formed during β-oxidation of fatty acids and can be used as fuel for the brain and central nervous system.
PMC3279728	D00040	In a normal situation, lipids undergo β-oxidation eventually resulting in the accumulation of acetyl-CoA which may then enter the TCA cycle for energy production.
PMC3279728	D00041	However, if the levels of acetyl-CoA reach a point such that they exceed the requirements of the TCA cycle then the excess is directed towards the formation of ketone bodies such as 3-hydroxybutyrate.
PMC3279728	D00042	It is interesting to note from this study that while there was a reduction in the level of 3-hydroxybutyrate that there also was an increase in the levels of several DCAs.
PMC3279728	D00045	We demonstrated the importance of both amino acids and dicarboxylic acids in differentiating between the depressed and non-depressed groups with a predictive accuracy of 78.2%.
PMC3279728	D00046	However at this time, the relationship of increased DCA formation through ω-oxidation and depression is unclear.
PMC3279728	D00047	As others have noted, in humans, medium-chain dicarboxylic acids, e.g., adipic (C6), suberic (C8), sebacic (C10), and dodecanedioic (C12) acids, derive from the β-oxidation of longer-chain dicarboxylic acids.
PMC3279728	D00048	Long-chain dicarboxylic acids, in turn, are formed from the correspondent fatty acids by ω-oxidation in the microsomial membranes or are consumed with a diet rich in vegetables.
PMC3279728	D00056	The fact that about half of the control samples contained EDTA initially posed a problem, but we feel our approach adequately dealt with this issue.
PMC3279728	D00058	Furthermore, future studies will need to examine heart-failure related variables (e.g., ischemic versus non –ischemic heart failure, use of statins and other medications), comorbid medical conditions, and cardiac outcomes.
PMC3279728	D00061	Depressed subjects had reduced levels of ketone body formation along with increased levels of dicarboxylic acid (DCA) formation which suggested reduced β-oxidation and enhanced ω-oxidation of fatty acids in depressed subjects.
PMC3279728	D00062	Inositol levels were also reduced in the depressed subjects in relation to controls, a finding consistent with previous studies.
PMC3279728	M00000	Depressed patients were participants in SADHART-CHF, a NIMH-sponsored, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study that is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of sertraline in the treatment of heart failure patients with major depression (clinicaltrials.gov registry number NCT00078286).
PMC3279728	M04002	The resulting plasma was aliquoted in cryogenic vial tubes (Fisher Scientific microtube 2mL Catalog#: NC9739217) and frozen at −80° C. Of note, 21 of the controls had blood drawn using Vacutainer tubes (Ref# 362788) containing the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).
PMC3279728	M05002	The resulting plasma was aliquoted in cryogenic vial tubes (Fisher Scientific microtube 2mL Catalog#: NC9739217) and frozen at −80° C. Of note, 21 of the controls had blood drawn using Vacutainer tubes (Ref# 362788) containing the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).
PMC3279728	M09004	ANCOVA analyses were used to account for additional variable in the data including subject age, statin use and ejection fraction (EF).
PMC3279728	M09005	As mentioned earlier, this data set consisted of two sets of control samples, 19 collected in tubes with clot activator and gel for plasma separation and 21 with tubes containing EDTA.
PMC3279728	M09006	Conversely, plasma samples isolated from the depressed subjects were collected with only the clot activator and gel for plasma separation and therefore did not contain EDTA.
PMC3279728	M09007	For the statistical analysis of this data, we initially identified biochemicals that were significantly different within the control group based on the presence or absence of EDTA.
PMC3279728	M09008	Then, for biochemicals with a significant EDTA difference within the control group, we proceeded with the 19 non-EDTA samples in subsequent analyses with the depressed group.
PMC3279728	M09009	For those biochemicals without a significant EDTA difference within the control group, we used all 40 control group subjects in comparison with the depressed group.
PMC3279728	R00003	Control subjects had lower ejection fractions, while depressed subjects had higher use of statin drugs.
PMC3279728	R00007	However, when we limited our analysis to only those samples that were collected without EDTA, the comparisons identified 63 significantly different biochemicals: 40 with increased concentrations and 23 with decreased concentrations within depressed subjects compared with their control counterparts.
PMC3279728	R01004	Within this study, phenylalanine, aspartate acid and serine were among the amino acids that were significantly elevated in depressed subjects compared with controls.
PMC3279728	R01006	However 3-methyl-2-oxobutyrate, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate and 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, which are associated with valine, leucine and isoleucine metabolism, were not found to be significantly altered in depressed subjects.
PMC3279728	R01009	Ratio of normalized biochemical concentrations within depressed subjects in comparison with non-depressed controls For analyses related to lipid metabolism we examined concentrations of ketone bodies and dicarboxylic acids (DCAs, see ).
PMC3279728	R01010	There were reduced levels of the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate in depressed versus control subjects.
PMC3279728	R01012	These include an increase in the levels of azelate, suberate, sebacate and 3-hydroxysebacate.
PMC3279728	R01013	As described below, several DCA were identified through the random forest analysis as some of the most important biochemicals in the discrimination between depressed and non-depressed subjects from this study.
PMC3279728	R01014	We then performed a series of ANVOVA analyses to examine effects of age, statin use and ejection fraction.
PMC3279728	R01015	Compounds that were identified as having a significant age effect (p<0.05 and q<0.1) were limited to glutamate, hypoxanthine, xanthine and trigonelline.
PMC3279728	R01016	Further analysis indicated while there was a significant age effect with the above mentioned compounds, there were no significant effect detected with either statin use or ejection fraction with any of the compounds detected within this study (p<0.05 and q<0.1).
PMC3279728	R02000	We used the entire metabolite dataset derived from plasma without EDTA for Random Forest analysis to classify depressed and non-depressed subjects in this study.
PMC3279728	R02002	Of the 19 control group subjects without EDTA, 15 were correctly classified as non-depressed subjects while only 4 were incorrectly classified as belonging to the depressed group.
PMC3279728	R02003	From , there appear to be seven biochemicals that are particularly important in differentiating the depressed subjects from the control subjects: unnamed biochemical X-4807, azelate, aspartate, X-11805, 3-hydroxysebacate, sebacate and aspartylphenylalanine.
PMC3279728	R02004	Overall, 43 of the 59 plasma samples from groups B and C without EDTA were correctly classified which resulted in a predictive accuracy of 43/59=72.8%.
PMC3279728	R02006	It is interesting to note that three of the top biochemicals (azelate, 3-hydroxysebacate and sebacate) that contributed to the discrimination of depressed from non-depressed subjects, are DCAs associated with ω-oxidation of fatty acids.
PMC3279728	R02008	Aspartate, as mentioned earlier, is an important neurotransmitter and was also very effective in discriminating between depressed and control subjects.
PMC3287345	A00000	The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health’s Office of Dietary Supplements (NIH-ODS), has developed a Standard Reference Material (SRM) for the determination of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] in serum.

PMC3287345	R00001	In addition, the presence of 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 in samples from infants had recently been reported, and the (undetected) presence of this analyte was identified as a potential source of error in mass spectrometry-based measurements of 25(OH)D.
PMC3287345	R00002	In outlining the specifications for SRM 972, NIST worked with NIH-ODS and a panel of experts in the vitamin D field.
PMC3287345	R00008	In the absence of supplementation with vitamin D_2 , the level of 25(OH)D_2 in Level 1 was expected and was confirmed to be low.
PMC3287345	R00014	Level 4 was prepared by fortifying normal human serum with 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 .
PMC3287345	R01000	Initial value assignment efforts for SRM 972 involved the development of an ID LC-MS approach to measure 25(OH)D. Based on previous literature reports, we did not anticipate measurable concentrations of 3-epi-25(OH)D in Levels 1, 2, or 3 because these pools were based upon human serum collected from adult donors.
PMC3287345	R01004	Therefore, a chromatographic separation of the two major metabolites of interest, 25(OH)D_2 and 25(OH)D_3 , was developed using a C_18 stationary phase and a methanol:water mobile phase.
PMC3287345	R01007	The sample preparation scheme for LC-MS measurements employed a mixture of 2-propanol and methanol to precipitate sample proteins and liberate the 25(OH)D species present.
PMC3287345	R01008	This was followed by extraction of the 25(OH)D species into hexane.
PMC3287345	R01011	For Level 4 of SRM 972, which contains 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 , a second LC-MS approach was developed to allow the quantification of 25(OH)D_3 and 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 .
PMC3287345	R01014	previously reported the use of a cyanopropyl stationary phase to achieve the partial chromatographic resolution of 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 from 25(OH)D_3 and 25(OH)D_2 in human serum samples.
PMC3287345	R01015	We modified their mobile phase conditions slightly to improve the resolution between 25(OH)D_3 and 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 .
PMC3287345	R01018	A small peak eluting after 25(OH)D_3 was observed, and the chromatographic retention and mass (m/z ) of this species were consistent with that of 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 based upon injection of a standard solution of 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 .
PMC3287345	R01019	Further investigation and consultation with experts in the vitamin D field indicated that 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 could be present in samples from adults.
PMC3287345	R01020	However, the concentration of the putative 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 could not be quantified in the first three levels of SRM 972 with the desired level of precision by LC-MS, and we elected to pursue LC-MS/MS methodology to further investigate this species.
PMC3287345	R01022	In addition, this alternative approach was appropriate for determination of 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 in Level 4 of SRM 972, which had been fortified with 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 .
PMC3287345	R01023	Because a labeled internal standard was not available for 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 , we utilized the labeled 25(OH)D_3 as the internal standard for these measurements.
PMC3287345	R01024	Selected ion chromatograms (LC-MS) for vitamin D metabolites and their labeled internal standards in Level 3 of SRM 972.
PMC3287345	R02005	Because it appeared from the LC-MS results that 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 was present in Levels 1, 2, and 3 at low concentrations, we elected to include this analyte in the LC-MS/MS method development process.
PMC3287345	R02006	For the determination of 25(OH)D_3 and 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 , the chromatographic separation employed in the LC-MS work was further optimized to obtain baseline resolution of these two analytes.
PMC3287345	R02008	Because we did not have a labeled internal standard for 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 , we utilized 25(OH)D_3 - for quantification of both 25(OH)D_3 and 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 .
PMC3287345	R02010	As shown in the Figure, baseline resolution of 25(OH)D_3 and 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 was achieved on the cyano column.
PMC3287345	R02013	Measurements of 25(OH)D_3 and 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 were made using a Zorbax CN column (A) and measurements of 25(OH)D_2 were made using a Zorbax XDB-C_18 column (B).
PMC3287345	R02017	We also investigated the possible presence of 3-epi-25(OH)D_2 in the SRM serum pools using a similar approach to that used for 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 , but none was detected.
PMC3287345	R03001	It should be noted that measurement of 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 was not included in the CDC method, and the chromatographic method employed did not resolve 25(OH)D_3 from 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 .
PMC3287345	R04003	One of the NIST LC-MS methods chromatographically resolved the 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 from 25(OH)D_3 and the other did not.
PMC3287345	R04004	The CDC LC-MS/MS method also did not account for the presence of 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 in any of the four levels of SRM 972.
PMC3287345	R04005	However, the NIST LC-MS/MS method quantified 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 in all four levels of SRM 972, and this value could be used to adjust or correct the other data sets for the presence of 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 .
PMC3287345	R04007	Ultimately we elected to use the concentrations of 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 determined by the NIST LC-MS/MS method to adjust the 25(OH)D_3 concentrations determined by the NIST LC-MS method employing a C_18 column and those determined by the CDC LC-MS/MS method.
PMC3287345	R04011	As can be seen in the table, there is excellent agreement among the methods after the adjustment for the presence of 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 .
PMC3287345	R04012	Method-specific results (ng/g) for measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 in SRM 972.
PMC3287345	R04017	Because the corresponding 3-epimer, 3-epi-25(OH)D_2 , was not detected in any of the four levels of SRM 972, the combination of measurements to obtain the certified or reference values for 25(OH)D_2 was relatively straightforward, and no correction of the data was necessary.
PMC3287345	R04018	Method specific results (ng/g) for measurement of 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 in SRM 972.
PMC3287345	R04025	Calculation of the expanded uncertainties for each of the certified and reference values also included consideration of Type B contributions to the overall uncertainty, and were calculated according to the method described in the ISO Guide._,  provides a summary of the certified and reference values for 25(OH)D_2 , 25(OH)D_3 , and 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 in SRM 972.
PMC3287345	R04028	The concentration of 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 in Levels 1, 2, and 3 was determined using a single method (NIST LC-MS/MS), and these concentrations are also reported as reference values.
PMC3287345	R04030	The certified value for 3-epi-25(OH)D_3 in Level 4 was assigned using data from the NIST LC-MS (cyano column) and NIST LC-MS/MS methods.
PMC3348551	A00000	Go to: 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) is a carcinogenic nitrosamine produced upon curing tobacco.
PMC3348551	A00001	It is present in tobacco smoke and undergoes metabolism to 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) in the lungs.
PMC3348551	A00002	NNAL undergoes further uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-mediated metabolism to give N- and O-glucuronide metabolites, which together with free (non-conjugated)
PMC3348551	A00006	We describe a novel derivatization procedure, which results in the formation of a pre-ionized N -propyl-NNAL derivative.
PMC3348551	A00010	Effects of inter-individual differences in urinary creatinine clearance on NNAL concentrations were then assessed and three metabolizer phenotypes were identified in the 60 subjects from the ratio of urinary NNAL glucuronides/free NNAL.
PMC3348551	A01002	4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a carcinogenic nitrosamine produced upon curing tobacco, is present at relatively high concentrations in tobacco smoke.
PMC3348551	A01004	The ketone that is present at C-1 of NNK is rapidly reduced to an alcohol in the lung primarily by aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) of the 1C family, carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD1) to give the carcinogenic NNAL metabolite.
PMC3348551	A01005	NNK is rapidly converted into NNAL in the lung and then activated by CYP2A6 and CYP2A13 to hydroxylated reactive metabolites that alkylate DNA with the concomitant formation of keto alcohol and diol metabolites, respectively.
PMC3348551	A01006	NNAL is also converted into its O -glucuronide by UGT1A9, UGT2B7, and UGT2B17 and to its N -glucuronide by UGT1A4 and UG2B10.
PMC3348551	A01007	The O - and N -glucuronide conjugates of NNAL are subsequently excreted in the urine.
PMC3348551	A01009	Therefore, the absolute amount of free NNAL that is excreted together with the ratio of glucuronide metabolites to free NNAL can be employed as biomarkers to predict an individual’s risk of tobacco smoke-induced lung cancer.
PMC3348551	A01021	We have used this derivatization procedure coupled with SID LC/MRM-MS to validate an assay for NNAL and its glucuronide metabolites in the urine of tobacco smokers.
PMC3348551	A01022	This has made it possible to examine the relationship between the urinary concentrations of NNAL and its glucuronide metabolites and creatinine excretion in limited urine volumes.
PMC3348551	M00003	Major exclusion criteria for the study were history of malignancy or chronic lung, cardiac, renal, or liver disease, and current nicotine replacement use.
PMC3348551	M01000	4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL) and 4-(methyl-[_2 H_3 ]-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol ([_2 H_3 ]-NNAL) were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada).
PMC3348551	M01001	HPLC grade acetonitrile, ethyl acetate and ammonium acetate were obtained from Fisher Scientific Co. (Fair Lawn, NJ, USA).
PMC3348551	M01003	Sodium phosphate monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, methyl iodide, ethyl iodide, n -propyl iodide and formic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA).
PMC3348551	M02003	Solvent A was aqueous 10 mM ammonium acetate containing 1% acetonitrile and 0.01% (v/v) formic acid, and solvent B was acetonitrile.
PMC3348551	M03000	The mass spectrometer was tuned to its optimal sensitivity by directly infusing a solution of aqueous 1000 ng/mL of derivatized NNAL into the ion source via a syringe pump with a continuous infusion of 50% acetonitrile containing 10 mM ammonium acetate and 0.01% formic acid (v/v) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min.
PMC3348551	M04000	Solutions of NNAL and [_2 H_3 ]-NNAL were prepared separately at a concentration of 1000 ng/mL from respective parent stocks of 1 mg/mL in methanol through serial dilution in methanol and kept frozen at −20°C.
PMC3348551	M05002	[_2 H_3 ]-NNAL (1 ng/mL final concentration) internal standard solution followed by addition of 200 µL of sodium phosphate buffer (1 M, pH 6.8).
PMC3348551	M05006	Ethyl acetate (2 mL) was added, and the samples were extracted by vortex-mixing for 5 min.
PMC3348551	M05007	The two phases were separated by centrifugation at high speed for 5 min; the upper ethyl acetate layer was transferred to 15 mL glass centrifuge tubes and dried under a N_2 stream.
PMC3348551	M05008	Dried urine extracts were then derivatized by addition of 100 µL acetonitrile/n -propyl iodide 80/20 (v/v).
PMC3348551	M05010	The reaction mixture was then dried under a N_2 stream and dissolved in 1% formic acid in water.
PMC3348551	M05011	Ethyl acetate (6 mL) was added, vortex-mixed, the tubes centrifuged, and the upper ethyl acetate layer was discarded.
PMC3348551	M05012	The pH of the aqueous phase was increased to 8 by addition of 0.5 mL of 5% ammonium hydroxide in water and purified using a WCX (Waters) solid-phase extraction (SPE) column, which is a weak mixed-mode cation exchanger suitable for extraction of quaternary amines.
PMC3348551	M05013	Elution of the derivative was performed using 1 mL of 5% formic acid in methanol.
PMC3348551	R00003	Therefore, the initial mobile phase was chosen as 100% 10 mM aqueous ammonium acetate containing 1% acetonitrile and 0.01% formic acid (v/v).
PMC3348551	R01000	Using HESI in the positive ion mode, N -propyl-NNAL and [_2 H_3 ]-N -propyl-NNAL exhibited intense M_+ at m/z 252 and 255, respectively.
PMC3348551	R01001	CID and MS/MS analysis of M_+ (m/z 252) from N -propyl-NNAL revealed product ions at m/z 222, 191, 163, 150, 135, and 122.
PMC3348551	R01010	Product ion spectra of (A) N -propyl-NNAL and (B) [_2 H_3 ]-N -propyl-NNAL.
PMC3348551	R02002	Deuterium exchange could have been problematic because methanol was used as stock solvent for NNAL and deuterated NNAL and acidic conditions were employed for purifying the derivative from the urine.
PMC3348551	R02005	Furthermore, there was <0.02 min separation between the deuterium and protium forms of the NNAL propionate derivatives, which would minimize any differential suppression of ionization between the analyte and its deuterated internal standard.
PMC3348551	R04007	This confirmed that N -propyl-NNAL was stable in the autosampler.
PMC3348551	R04010	No significant deterioration in the urinary NNAL or glucuronide metabolites was observed.
PMC3348551	R05004	Typical chromatograms for the analysis of N -propyl-NNAL in the urine of a smoker before and after treatment with β-glucuronidase are shown in .
PMC3348551	R06002	Free NNAL concentrations ranged from 20 to 635.8 pg/mL (0.1 to 3.0 nM) with a mean of 151.6 pg/mL, SEM ± 17.9 pg/mL (0.7 ± 0.1 nM), conjugated NNAL concentrations ranged from 0.1 to 14.6 nM with a mean of 2.63 ± 0.39 nM, and total concentrations ranged from 0.2 nM to 16.0 nM with a mean of 3.4 ± 0.5 nM. Urinary creatinine concentrations for the 60 subjects were determined by LC/MS using a modification of a previously published procedure and NNAL values were then corrected for urine flow.
PMC3348551	R06003	A similar trend was observed when NNAL values were expressed as pmol/mg creatinine when compared with concentrations expressed as nM. There were some striking inter-individual differences in the ratio of NNAL-glucuronides/free NNAL using either concentration or values normalized for creatinine clearance.
PMC3348551	R06005	Comparison of free, conjugated and total urinary NNAL for 60 smokers: (A)NNAL (nM) and (B) NNAL pmol/mg creatinine.
PMC3371049	D00047	From a biological point of view the metabolites having a relatively high contribution in the K-PLS-DA model, e.g. urea, glutamine, lactate, citrate, valine, are consistent with biological knowledge.
PMC3371049	M01003	We used 3-(Trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d_4 acid sodium salt (TSP-d_4 99 at.%D) as internal standard for chemical shift reference (δ 0.00 ppm) and metabolite quantification.
PMC3371049	M01005	The buffer solution solvated in a mixture of water and D_2 O consists of 2,85 mM TSP, 6.92 mM sodium azide (NaN_3 ) and 42.08 mM sodium phosphate dibasic dehydrate (Na_2 HPO_4 •2H_2 O).
PMC3371049	M01007	The pH of the CSF NMR sample was adjusted to around 7 (7.0–7.1) by the buffering capacity of the phosphate in the buffer solution.
PMC3371049	M03002	Human CSF samples (100 µL) were deproteinized by adding 400 µL methanol and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 10000 rpm.
PMC3371049	M03003	The supernatant was dried under N_2 followed by derivatization with methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) in pyridine similar to Koek et al. .
PMC3371049	R03014	A variable which shows a non-linear trend is glutamine and is derived from NMR.
PMC3371049	R03015	Valine is characterized by linearity and monotonicity in its low range, and non-linearity in its high range.
PMC3371049	R03016	Urea and sucrose demonstrate linearity over the whole concentration range.
PMC3371049	R03019	The levels of lactate and of valine both increase, while the concentration of glutamine and citrate is reduced with disease progression.
PMC3371049	R03024	For instance, pseudo sample trajectories for glutamine derived from NMR and GC-MS reveal very similar evolution upon disease progression.
PMC3371049	R03025	Correspondingly, pseudo sample for lactate, glucose and citrate measured by NMR and GC-MS display comparable trajectories along concentration range.
PMC3381959	M00000	2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate-d_6 (DSS), 3-(Trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d_4 acid sodium salt (TSP), D_2 O, potassium phosphate (monobasic, dibasic), methanol, and chloroform were obtained from Sigma/Aldrich (Milwaukee, USA) and used as received.
PMC3381959	M03001	Briefly, the cell pellet was extracted with a 1/1/1 v/v/v of ice-cold methanol, chloroform, and water.
PMC3381959	M03003	The dried samples were brought to room temperature and re-dissolved in 400 μL phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.2 prepared with D_2 O) containing 1 mM DSS prior to NMR measurement.
PMC3381959	M03004	Urine samples were thawed and 450 μL of each sample was added to 50 μL of 1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing TSP ([TSP]_f = 3 mM), prepared in D_2 O.
PMC3381959	M04003	Signal intensity in the water region (4.5 – 5.0 ppm) and water + urea region (4.5 – 6.0 ppm) was set to 0 in the spectra of all cell line and urine samples, respectively.
PMC3381959	R00005	In the case of cell line extracts, the chemical shift variation before application of an alignment algorithm is already minimal, however this is not the case for the urine spectra (e.g. citrate region).
PMC3381959	R00008	Inset: expansion between 2.4 – 2.85 ppm highlighting the citrate chemical shift region.
PMC3381959	R02023	Interpreting the simplicity value and associated PCA parameters is complicated in the case of the low resolution data set due to the presence of strong glucose signals in two of the twenty samples.
PMC3381959	R02024	Any improvement as a result of alignment is masked since the glucose signals strongly dominate the PCA models.
PMC3392760	A02000	Long-chain fatty acids, including palmitate and oleate, decreased in smokers by 0.76-fold (P = 0.0045) and 0.72-fold (P = 0.0112), respectively.
PMC3392760	D00006	While we are able to detect particular orally ingested antioxidants such as carotenoids in the skin, quantitative measures of other antioxidants (such as catechins) in the skin can be difficult.
PMC3392760	D00010	Previous studies have shown that cigarette smoke directly depletes the levels of circulating antioxidants and vitamins, such as ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, lycopene, and retinol [,].
PMC3392760	D00016	From the metabolomic analysis, the levels of cotinine, a well-known metabolite of nicotine, did not significantly change in either group after 12 weeks of supplementation.
PMC3392760	D00027	Evidence that supports this idea is that two markers of excessive carbon flow into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, beta-hydroxybutyrate and 2-hydroxybutyrate, decline with supplementation.
PMC3392760	D00028	These arise when either too much carbon is produced relative to tricarboxylic acid cycle capacity or the tricarboxylic acid cycle is not operating at full capacity.
PMC3392760	M00013	Subjects received a commercially available nutritional supplement containing multiple commonly available antioxidant compounds (including catechins, carotenoids, lycopene, and vitamins C, E and A), a number of common vitamins with no antioxidant properties, and omega-3 fatty acids (Additional file ).
PMC3392760	M01009	The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid in H_2 O (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in methanol (solvent B).
PMC3392760	M03008	To confirm intake of supplements, palmar skin carotenoid levels were measured by Raman spectrophotometry (Pharmanex Biophotonic Scanner, Provo, UT, USA).
PMC3392760	R00005	Body mass index, postmenopausal status, hormonal therapy and caffeine intake were not significantly different between the smoking group and non-smoking group.
PMC3392760	R00010	Study supplement usage was confirmed by increases in subjects' palmar skin carotenoid levels, as measured by Raman spectroscopy.
PMC3392760	R00011	In smokers, counts indicating carotenoid levels increased an average of 15,055.25 ± 11,674.18 photon units at week 12; in non-smokers, levels increased an average of 16,640.59 ± 13,595.16 units at week 12.
PMC3392760	R01016	In the supplemented smoking group, 11 out of the 16 LCFAs (including palmitate, stearate, oleate, and linoleate) significantly decreased.
PMC3392760	R01019	Stearidonate was the only LCFA that did not decrease over 12 weeks in the smoker group.
PMC3392760	R01020	In both smokers and non-smoker groups, stearidonate increased over 12 weeks.
PMC3392760	R01021	Of note, stearidonate is an omega-3-fatty acid, a component of the supplement.
PMC3392760	R01022	This may explain increases in stearidonate in both smoker and non-smoker groups.
PMC3392760	R01024	Pantothenate, alpha-tocopherol and pyridoxate were significantly increased in non-smokers, as would be expected after supplementation.
PMC3392760	R01025	Interestingly, the degree of increase in smokers for alpha-tocopherol and pyridoxate was not significant, suggesting possible increased conversion, excretion or decreased absorption of these substances compared to non-smokers.
PMC3392760	R01026	Another significant change was an increase in bilirubin levels (part of the heme degradation pathway) in non-smokers after supplementation, a change not seen in supplemented smokers.
PMC3392760	R01027	The clinical and biologic significance of this change is currently unclear, although it is possible that the supplemented non-smokers increased heme breakdown or decreased excretion of bilirubin compared to supplemented smokers.
PMC3406255	A00000	Glioblastomas (GBMs) and brain metastases demonstrate avid uptake of _18 fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (FDG) by positron emission tomography (PET) and display perturbations of intracellular metabolite pools by _1 H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
PMC3406255	A00002	The Warburg effect, excess metabolism of glucose to lactate in the presence of oxygen, is a hallmark of cancer cells in culture.
PMC3406255	A00003	FDG-positive tumors are assumed to metabolize glucose in a similar manner, with high rates of lactate formation compared to mitochondrial glucose oxidation, but few studies have specifically examined the metabolic fates of glucose in vivo .
PMC3406255	A00004	In particular, the capacity of human brain malignancies to oxidize glucose in the tricarboxylic acid cycle is unknown.
PMC3406255	A00007	Analysis of tumor metabolites revealed lactate production, as expected.
PMC3406255	A00008	We also determined that pyruvate dehydrogenase, turnover of the TCA cycle, anaplerosis and de novo glutamine and glycine synthesis contributed significantly to the ultimate disposition of glucose carbon.
PMC3406255	A00009	Surprisingly, less than 50% of the acetyl-CoA pool was derived from blood-borne glucose, suggesting that additional substrates contribute to tumor bioenergetics.
PMC3406255	A01000	Cancer, glioblastoma, metabolism, Warburg effect, glucose, glutamine, NMR
PMC3406255	D00001	First, we used _13 C-glucose to probe the metabolism of human gliomas and brain metastases in situ .
PMC3406255	D00002	This produced a novel and biologically relevant view of glucose metabolism in these tumors, a significant step forward from previous metabolic studies relying exclusively on cancer cell lines cultured in glucose excess
PMC3406255	D00004	Second, glucose and other fuels were oxidized in the TCA cycle of these tumors, indicating that energy production involves numerous pathways in addition to the Warburg effect.
PMC3406255	D00005	Third, the metabolism of eleven individual tumors was remarkably similar, suggesting that it is a common feature of aggressive tumor growth in the brain rather than the effect of a specific mutation or histological type. _13 C-enriched glucose and detection of _13 C-enriched products by NMR has been applied in earlier studies of tumor metabolism using the rat C6 glioma model.
PMC3406255	D00006	This malignancy was induced in rats by exposure to N,N’-nitroso-methylurea, and tumor cells can either be cultured ex vivo or re-implanted into new hosts, producing tumors with morphological similarities to glioblastoma multiforme.
PMC3406255	D00008	Bouzier and colleagues, for example, found significant _13 C enrichment in glutamate, glutamine, GABA and aspartate from perchloric acid extracts of C6 gliomas resected after a 60 min infusion of [1-_13 C]glucose.
PMC3406255	D00009	Although it was not mentioned in this report, the published _13 C spectra appear to show _13 C – _13 C spin-spin coupling in glutamate, exactly as would be anticipated if a significant fraction of acetyl-CoA entering the TCA cycle was derived from [1-_13 C]glucose, as reported here for human tumors.
PMC3406255	D00011	Even after prolonged infusion, enrichment of glutamate carbons 3 and 4 was readily detected in normal brain but not in the tumor.
PMC3406255	D00012	For this reason, the mathematical analysis of glucose metabolism in that report rested on the assumption that oxidation in the TCA cycle was negligible.
PMC3406255	D00013	The _13 C labeling pattern in glucose, [U-_13 C]glucose, was chosen over alternatives because the intent was to achieve maximal enrichment of the pyruvate pool to increase the likelihood of detecting flux through PDH.
PMC3406255	D00014	This labeling pattern eliminates the ambiguity associated with labeling patterns producing singly-labeled acetyl-CoA, such as [1-_13 C]glucose or [1,6-_13 C]glucose, because the resulting singlets in glutamate can be difficult to distinguish from natural abundance _13 C if turnover of the TCA cycle is slow.
PMC3406255	D00015	Although [1,2-_13 C]glucose is preferable to detect activity of the oxidative pentose phosphate shunt, only half of the pyruvate produced from [1,2-_13 C]glucose contains _13 C.
PMC3406255	D00022	Systemic infusion of _13 C-enriched glucose provides glucose to other organs such as the liver and skeletal muscle that could, in principle, generate _13 C enriched glutamine that could be transferred via the circulation to the tumor.
PMC3406255	D00023	However, this is unlikely because we detected only very small amounts of _13 C-glutamine in the plasma of these patients.
PMC3406255	D00024	Furthermore, investigators have developed “chemical biopsy” methods to probe labeling patterns in hepatic glutamine and glutamate precisely because the human liver does not ordinarily export significant amounts of these amino acids.
PMC3406255	D00025	We also considered the possibility that _13 C-labeled glutamate and/or glutamine was synthesized in the surrounding brain and then transferred to the tumor, exaggerating the ability of the tumor to oxidize glucose and produce these intermediates.
PMC3406255	D00026	Indeed, an earlier study used microdialysis to demonstrate that human brain releases glutamine synthesized de novo from _13 C-labeled nutrients into the interstitial space.
PMC3406255	D00027	No release of _13 C-glutamate was detected in that study.
PMC3406255	D00028	However, examination of the tumor spectra in our study does not support a model in which the _13 C detected in tumor glutamate/glutamine originated from extracellular glutamine generated by adjacent tissue.
PMC3406255	D00029	If _13 C-glutamine entered the tumor from the interstitial space, and then was converted to glutamate, the fractional enrichment in glutamine would exceed that of glutamate.
PMC3406255	D00030	But we observed the opposite, as demonstrated by the differences in glutamate and glutamine multiplets, as illustrated in .
PMC3406255	D00031	Here the ratio of the singlet from natural abundance _13 C to the doublet from de novo synthesis is much higher in glutamine than glutamate.
PMC3406255	D00032	This indicates a lower fractional enrichment in glutamine, and the pattern suggests that _13 C passes through the glutamate pool before reaching glutamine, rather than the opposite.
PMC3406255	D00033	This is most consistent with de novo synthesis of both glutamate and glutamine from glucose within the tumor.
PMC3406255	D00035	Glucose metabolism through PDH and the TCA cycle was active in both primary and metastatic tumors.
PMC3406255	D00038	The findings argue against the conventional perception of metabolism in _18 FDG-PET-positive tumors: that tumor glucose handling is dominated by production of the end products lactate and alanine.
PMC3406255	D00042	Unexpectedly, we found that blood-borne glucose provided only a minority of the acetyl-CoA in the tumor TCA cycle.
PMC3406255	D00043	This finding contrasts with the normal brain, in which 95% of oxidative metabolism is supplied by glucose.
PMC3406255	D00045	First, we assumed that the fractional enrichment of blood-borne glucose matched the enrichment in glucose available to the tumor.
PMC3406255	D00047	Second, the mathematical analysis requires that the tumor sample is homogeneous with respect to glucose metabolism.
PMC3406255	D00050	With these assumptions in mind, the data imply that tumors oxidize other substrates in addition to blood-borne glucose.
PMC3406255	D00051	Metabolism of these alternative fuels, which could include glycogen, fatty acids, amino acids or organic acids, might be suitable therapeutic targets in human GBM because their utilization in the rest of the brain is expected to be minimal.
PMC3406255	D00052	Another possibility is that cytoplasmic lipid droplets contained in human and animal gliomas provide a dynamic reservoir of substrate for the production of acetyl-CoA in the mitochondria.
PMC3406255	D00054	In addition to its role in producing energy, glucose also contributed to biosynthesis.
PMC3406255	D00055	Carbon from glucose was used to supply pools of the macromolecular precursors glutamate, glutamine, and glycine, which are required for protein and nucleic acid synthesis.
PMC3406255	D00056	Production of glutamine was particularly evident in GBMs, where the total _13 C NMR signal in glutamine exceeded the signal in corresponding glutamate carbons ( and ).
PMC3406255	D00057	Glycine is generated from the glycolytic intermediate 3-phosphoglycerate, which supplies carbon both to serine and glycine.
PMC3406255	D00058	We recently used in vivo _1 H MRS to identify a subset of human GBMs with high intracellular glycine content.
PMC3406255	D00059	Detection of glycine in the breast metastasis is of particular interest since phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the serine/glycine biosynthesis pathway, is commonly over-expressed in human breast adenocarcinoma, is amplified at the genomic level in a subset of these tumors, and is essential for tumor growth in a human breast cancer xenograft model.
PMC3406255	D00060	Therefore the detection of glycine synthesis in vivo is likely to yield important information relevant to tumor growth.
PMC3406255	D00064	For example, mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase isoforms 1 and 2 are commonly found in low-grade gliomas and influence intermediary metabolism, including some of the pathways analyzed in this work [–].
PMC3406255	D00065	There should be no major obstacles to extending this method to study low-grade gliomas and, importantly, to study the metabolism of other nutrients besides glucose.
PMC3406255	M00006	These were identified from the region of tumor that enhanced most evenly on a pre-operative MR scan, correlated with avid _18 FDG glucose uptake, and/or was identified intraoperatively using fixed anatomic landmarks or surgical navigation (VectorVision, Brainlab Inc, Westchester, IL).
PMC3406255	M00012	DNA sequencing revealed that none of these tumors had mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase isoforms 1 or 2 (IDH1 or IDH2 ).
PMC3406255	M01003	A 10µL aliquot was vortexed with 40µL of water and extracted in equal volumes of chloroform, methanol and water.
PMC3406255	M01004	The aqueous phase was re-extracted with chloroform, evaporated, derivatized in 100µL of a trimethylsilyl donor (TriSil, Pierce), and analyzed using an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5973N Mass Selective Detector.
PMC3406255	M01005	Glucose enrichment was determined by comparing the ratio of fragment ions 206 and 441 (enriched) and 204 and 435 (unenriched) to a standard curve.
PMC3406255	M01006	To determine _13 C enrichment in lactate and glutamine, the measured distribution of mass isotopomers was corrected for natural abundance.
PMC3406255	M02001	The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, where chloroform/tri-n-octylamine (78%/22%; v/v) was added in a 1:2 volumetric ratio to increase the pH to ~6.
PMC3406255	M02013	Each peak was fitted with a Gauss-Lorentz function and the area was measured for all peaks within informative multiplets. _13 C NMR spectra and glutamate isotopomers were analyzed as described previously using steady-state and non steady-state analyses.
PMC3406255	R00002	A gadolinium-enhancing right temporoparietal mass with cystic and solid components displayed avid uptake of _18 FDG at the tumor margins.
PMC3406255	R00003	_13 C-glucose enrichment in the plasma gradually increased during the infusion to a maximum of 25% at the time of tumor sampling.
PMC3406255	R00004	Mass spectrometry revealed that essentially all of the plasma glucose was either unlabeled or labeled in all six positions, with only a small fraction (3±2% for all patients in the study) containing one to five _13 C atoms.
PMC3406255	R00005	Thus essentially all of the labeled glucose entering the tumor was [U-_13 C]glucose.
PMC3406255	R00006	Despite the relatively low enrichment in plasma glucose, _13 C–_13 C spin-spin coupling was detected in many tumor metabolites.
PMC3406255	R00007	Coupling reflects adjacent _13 C nuclei arising from the metabolism of [U-_13 C]glucose. _13 C–_13 C coupling was observed in lactate and alanine, as expected for a high rate of glucose metabolism to pyruvate in glycolytic cells. _13 C–_13 C coupling was also detected in glycine, an intermediate in nucleotide and protein synthesis recently identified as an important fate of glucose carbon in some tumor cells [, ].
PMC3406255	R00008	The signal in lactate carbon 2 (LAC2) showed a large doublet of doublets, reflecting labeling at all three lactate carbons.
PMC3406255	R00009	The LAC2 multiplet also contained small 2–3 and 1–2 doublets, demonstrating that not all of the lactate in the tumor was uniformly labeled.
PMC3406255	R00010	These patterns arise from entry of glucose carbon into the TCA cycle followed by metabolism to pyruvate (pyruvate cycling) and lactate.
PMC3406255	R00012	(b) _18 FDG-PET scan demonstrating uptake of _18 FDG along the tumor margin and inferior to the cyst (arrow).
PMC3406255	R00013	The expected high rate of cortical _18 FDG signal with reduced uptake in white matter is apparent in the left hemisphere.
PMC3406255	R00014	The blunted _18 FDG signal in the right hemisphere superior to the tumor is likely a consequence of tumor-associated edema.
PMC3406255	R00016	(c) Percent _13 C enrichment in plasma glucose (Glc) over the 200-minute infusion of [U-_13 C]glucose at 4g/hr.
PMC3406255	R00017	Enrichment is the fraction of plasma glucose that was uniformly labeled with _13 C. Tumor samples were collected during the final 35 minutes (blue bar).
PMC3406255	R00020	Assignments for all spectra throughout the paper: (1) Lactate C2; (2) Glutamate C2; (3) Glutamine C2; (4) Aspartate C2; (5) Alanine C2; (6) Taurine C1; (7) Glycine C2; (8) N-Acetylaspartate C3; (9) GABA C4; (10) Creatine C2; (11) Aspartate C3; (12) Taurine C2; (13) GABA C2; (14) Glutamate C4; (15) Glutamine C4; (16) Glutamate C3; (17) Glutamine C3; (18) GABA C3; (19) N-Acetylaspartate C6; (20), Lactate C3; (21) Alanine C3.
PMC3406255	R00021	The insets, from left to right, are Lactate C2; Glycine C2; Glutamate C4; and Glutamate and Glutamine C3.
PMC3406255	R00023	Unexpectedly, glutamate and glutamine were also labeled in all carbons analyzed in each GBM.
PMC3406255	R00024	The 4–5 doublet in glutamate and glutamine carbon 4 is derived from [1,2-_13 C]acetyl-CoA produced from [U-_13 C]glucose, demonstrating that glucose was metabolized to acetyl-CoA via pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH).
PMC3406255	R00025	Labeling in glutamate carbon 2 and glutamate carbon 3 is consistent with turnover of the TCA cycle.
PMC3406255	R00026	The labeling patterns in glutamate and glutamine were similar at each carbon, demonstrating that glutamate was converted to glutamine by the enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS).
PMC3406255	R00027	However, a complete quantitative isotopomer analysis was not possible because of the poor resolution of some of the multiplets, particularly the doublet of doublets in glutamate carbon 4.
PMC3406255	R00030	Labeling beyond the first turn of the TCA cycle can be inferred from the _13 C distribution shown for citrate/isocitrate; additional detail is available.
PMC3406255	R00032	The overall metabolic network involved metabolism of glucose to lactate through glycolysis and through more complex metabolic pathways involving part of the TCA cycle and/or the pentose phosphate pathway (data not shown).
PMC3406255	R00033	Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), citrate synthase (CS), complete turnover of the TCA cycle, anaplerosis, and synthesis of glutamate and glutamine from glucose were evident in all eleven tumors.
PMC3406255	R00034	De novo glycine synthesis was apparent in the astrocytoma, the metastatic breast tumor, and in 7 of 8 glioblastomas.
PMC3406255	R00035	GS, glutamine synthetase.
PMC3406255	R00037	It contained abundant lactate (15.7 mM) compared to normal plasma levels (1–2 mM), and the _13 C NMR spectrum was dominated by lactate signals.
PMC3406255	R00038	Although small multiplets were present in the cyst lactate, unlike the tumor lactate, these multiplets were dwarfed by large singlets.
PMC3406255	R00039	Analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that less than 5% of the cyst lactate contained _13 C.
PMC3406255	R00040	Thus the singlets were due to naturally-occurring _13 C (1.1% of all carbon), rather than to lactate derived from _13 C-glucose, and entry of new glucose-derived lactate into the cyst did not occur rapidly enough to label a high fraction of this large pool.
PMC3406255	R00041	Like the plasma, the cyst fluid contained abundant glutamine (0.7 mM) and very little glutamate.
PMC3406255	R00042	Lack of _13 C–_13 C multiplets in glutamine revealed that tumor-derived glutamine was not secreted into the cyst over the time course of the infusion.
PMC3406255	R01000	We next tested the effects of higher enrichment in plasma glucose by infusing an initial bolus of 8g [U-_13 C]glucose over 10 minutes followed by a continuous infusion of 8g/hr.
PMC3406255	R01002	As anticipated, the patients displayed a rapid rise in _13 C labeling of plasma glucose, a 2–3 fold increase in final enrichment (typically exceeding 50%), and a long period of high enrichment in the plasma prior to tumor sampling.
PMC3406255	R01006	Small amounts of uniformly-labeled lactate (9 ± 5% of the total plasma lactate pool) and glutamine with two additional mass units from _13 C (4 ± 3% of the total plasma glutamine pool) were detected by mass spectrometry at the end of these infusions.
PMC3406255	R01010	(c) Time course of enrichment of plasma glucose (Glc).
PMC3406255	R01014	Abbreviation: T, triplet due to enrichment in carbons 2, 3 and 4 of glutamate or glutamine.
PMC3406255	R01017	In patient 3, no isotopmer analysis was performed because the resolution of the glutamate multiplets was poor.
PMC3406255	R01020	Anaplerosis is defined as the anaplerotic flux relative to citrate synthase activity. Fc3, fraction of acetyl-CoA containing _13 C in both carbons ([1,2-_13 C]acetyl-CoA).
PMC3406255	R01022	Even in the hyperglycemic patient with the lowest plasma glucose enrichment, there was excellent resolution of _13 C multiplets (patient 5, ). _13 C–_13 C coupling was observed in lactate and alanine in all tumors, and in glycine in 7 of the 8 GBM patients on either infusion protocol.
PMC3406255	R01023	Doublets were visible in LAC2, confirming pyruvate cycling in all of these tumors.
PMC3406255	R01024	The 4–5 doublets in glutamate and glutamine confirmed that PDH was active in all tumors.
PMC3406255	R01026	This multiplet demonstrates complete turnover of the TCA cycle because it can only occur if both acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate are enriched in _13 C.
PMC3406255	R01027	All signals within the GLU2, GLU3 and GLU4 multiplets were resolved well enough to integrate peak areas with high confidence, so it was possible to perform a complete analysis of glutamate isotopomers to determine enrichments and relative fluxes related to core pathways of glucose metabolism.
PMC3406255	R01029	We first determined the fractional enrichment in the acetyl-CoA pool (Fc3).
PMC3406255	R01030	In both models, a significant percentage of acetyl-CoA was labeled as [1,2-_13 C]acetyl-CoA in the tumor (15±7% in the NSS model and 11±6% in the SS model).
PMC3406255	R01031	Acetyl-CoA enrichment was positively correlated with plasma glucose enrichment.
PMC3406255	R01032	Surprisingly, however, in every tumor analyzed, the _13 C enrichment in acetyl-CoA was much lower than the glucose enrichment in the plasma.
PMC3406255	R01034	Again, although these tumors contained [1,2-_13 C]acetyl-CoA, the measured fractional enrichment in acetyl-CoA was far lower than the plasma glucose enrichment.
PMC3406255	R01035	These data suggest that other nutrients in addition to glucose were metabolized to acetyl-CoA and then oxidized in the TCA cycle to a significant degree in these tumors.
PMC3406255	R01037	b, _18 FDG-PET scan demonstrating uptake of _18 FDG in the region corresponding to T1 enhancement.
PMC3406255	R01040	d, Percent _13 C enrichment in plasma glucose (Glc).
PMC3406255	R01042	Note that this patient had steroid-induced hyperglycemia, and this resulted in a relatively low final enrichment in plasma glucose.
PMC3406255	R01045	Assignments and abbreviations are the same as in . _13 C enrichment in plasma glucose near the time of tumor sampling was determined by mass spectrometry for each patient.
PMC3406255	R01046	This value was plotted against the value of Fc3 (i.e. the fraction of acetyl-CoA entering the TCA cycle that was _13 C-labeled on both carbons, [1,2-_13 C]acetyl-CoA) determined from each tumor spectrum using a non-steady state analysis.
PMC3406255	R01047	Note that in every patient, _13 C enrichment in plasma glucose far exceeded Fc3.
PMC3406255	R02002	As measured by _13 C NMR isotopomer analysis, the anaplerotic flux in every tumor approached or exceeded entry of carbon into the TCA cycle via citrate synthase, with a total anaplerotic flux of 1.25 ± 0.43
PMC3406255	R02003	(mean and SD) relative to citrate synthase for the five GBMs infused at 8g/hr, indicating robust anaplerosis in these tumors.
PMC3406255	R03000	Taken together, these observations in high-grade gliomas demonstrate allocation of glucose carbon into multiple bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways.
PMC3406255	R03003	The _13 C NMR spectra from the breast metastasis and lung metastasis shared many of the features observed in the GBMs, including _13 C–_13 C multiplets in lactate, alanine, glutamate and glutamine.
PMC3406255	R03004	The breast metastasis also produced glycine from glucose (, multiplet #7).
PMC3406255	R03006	Steady-state modeling again revealed significant anaplerosis and enrichment in acetyl-CoA that was much lower than blood glucose.
PMC3406255	R03008	Pre-operative imaging included (a) T1-weighted post-gadolinium coronal image demonstrating a large, solitary right cerebellar mass and (b) _18 FDG-PET scan demonstrating uptake of _18 FDG within the mass.
PMC3406255	R03011	This tumor was positive for the HER-2 oncogene, and was negative for expression of the estrogen and progesterone receptors.
PMC3426673	A00000	Oxylipins, including eicosanoids, affect a broad range of biological processes, such as the initiation and resolution of inflammation.
PMC3426673	A00001	These compounds, also referred to as lipid mediators, are (non-) enzymatically generated by oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (AA).
PMC3426673	A00003	Here we developed a robust and sensitive targeted analysis platform for oxylipins and applied it in a biological setting, using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) operated in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM).
PMC3426673	A00004	Besides the well-described AA metabolites, oxylipins derived from linoleic acid, dihomo-γ-linolenic acid, α-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid were included.
PMC3426673	A00005	Our comprehensive platform allows the quantitative evaluation of approximately 100 oxylipins down to low nanomolar levels.
PMC3426673	A00007	Altered levels of some of the oxylipins, especially in certain monohydroxy fatty acids such as 12-HETE and 12-HEPE, were observed in samples collected before and 24 h after cardiac surgery.

PMC3426673	M00005	Deuterated and non-deuterated oxylipin standards were purchased either from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI), Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), or Larodan (Malmö, Sweden).
PMC3426673	M01000	Oxylipin profiling was performed on EDTA-plasma derived from patients before and after cardiac surgery.
PMC3426673	M01003	As patients develop a state of inflammation upon cardiac surgery, these patients provided a well controlled sample set to monitor levels of oxylipins in their function as bioactive lipid mediators after cardiac surgery.
PMC3426673	M01006	To avoid any effects of heparin, such as increased levels of oxylipins by heparin induced phopholipase A2 activity, described in literature [, ], samples collected during the period in which heparin was administered to the patient were not used.
PMC3426673	M01007	Heparin administrated in conjunction with heart–lung machine use is neutralized by protamine sulfate, administrated in the operating room directly after the surgical intervention.
PMC3426673	M01008	Based on our own confirmation of a heparin-dependent elevation in circulating oxylipins (data not shown) and their response to protamine sulfate treatment, we chose to analyze samples taken the day before surgery (no heparin administrated to the patient) and 24 h after reperfusion of the heart, when no influence of heparin could be detected.
PMC3426673	M01009	All baseline and 24 h post-reperfusion samples were taken at the same moment during the day, between 12:00 noon and 2:00 p.m., to reduce the potential impact of circadian rhythm-dependent cycling which can affect several oxylipins.
PMC3426673	M02001	All samples were collected in pre-cooled tubes containing EDTA (BD Vacutainer, Plymouth, UK) and placed on melting ice immediately.
PMC3426673	M02005	For oxylipin analysis 250 μL aliquots were taken.
PMC3426673	M02009	Oxylipins were eluted with 2 mL ethyl acetate after wetting the cartridge with 0.5 mL methanol.
PMC3426673	M02011	The dried extract was subsequently reconstituted in 50 μL solution of methanol and acetonitrile (1:1) containing 100 nM 1-cyclohexyluriedo-3-dodecanoic acid (CUDA) as a quality marker for the analysis.
PMC3426673	M03003	Chromatographic separation was achieved on an Ascentis Express (2.1 × 150 mm, 2.7 μm particles; Sigma-Aldrich Supelco) column using a flow rate of 0.35 mL/min at 40 °C during a 26 min gradient (0–3.5 min from 15 % B to 33 % B, 3.5–5.5 min B to 38 %, 5–7 min to 42 % B, 7–9 min to 48 % B, 9–15 min to 65 % B, 15–17 min to 75 % B, 17–18.5 min to 85 % B, 18.5–19.5 min to 95 % B, from 19.5 to 21 min to 15 % B, 21–26 min 15 % B), while using the solvents A, 0.1 % acetic acid, and B, 90:10 v /v acetonitril/isopropanol.
PMC3426673	M03007	To detect the individual oxylipins, MRM in negative ion mode was performed with individually optimized fragmentor voltage and collision energies (Optimizer application, MassHunter, Agilent).
PMC3426673	M05015	To determine the recovery of the oxylipins, we spiked the pooled plasma with 11 deuterated ISTDs prior to the extraction step and in parallel after the last step of the extraction procedure.
PMC3426673	R00000	A robust and sensitive quantitative method for profiling oxylipins such as eicosanoids and related lipid mediators biosynthesized from AA and other PUFAs was developed.
PMC3426673	R00002	Our LC-MS/MS method, employing dynamic MRM (dMRM), allows the evaluation of more than 100 oxylipins in a targeted approach (Fig.

PMC3448036	M01005	Thus, equol producers and nonproducers were distinguished based on the LOD, as established in a study of Korean subjects (Akaza et al. ).
PMC3448036	M03000	The demographic, anthropometric, and blood biochemical properties between equol producers and nonproducers were compared by χ_2 and t tests.

PMC344824	A01000	Incubation of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) with human plasma yielded a product that has been identified as 9-deoxy-9,10-didehydro-12,13-didehydro-13,14-dihydro-PGD2 (9-deoxy-delta 9, delta 12-13,14-dihydro-PGD2).
PMC344824	A01002	The conversion of PGD2 to this product was dependent on the incubation time and the amount of plasma added to a reaction mixture and was abolished by prior boiling.
PMC344824	A01003	The conversion rate of PGD2 to this metabolite was 0.03 nmol/min per mg of protein of whole plasma at pH 8.0 at 37 degrees C. Similar conversion was also found by incubating PGD2 with human serum albumin added at the concentration found in plasma.
PMC344824	A01004	These results suggest that the conversion of PGD2 to this product is catalyzed by the enzymatic action of a plasma protein, probably serum albumin.
PMC344824	A01007	On the other hand, it exhibited a three times stronger inhibitory activity (IC50, 1.8 microM) than PGD2 (IC50, 5 microM) on the growth of L-1210 cultured cells.
PMC3463959	A00003	We found that the intensities of six metabolites (LDL/VLDL, isoleucine, lactate, lipids, choline, and glucose/sugars) in serum of Yang deficiency syndrome patients were lower than those of non-Yang deficiency syndrome patients.
PMC3463959	A00005	The decreased intensities of metabolites including LDL/VLDL, isoleucine, lactate, lipids, choline, and glucose/sugars in serum may be the distinctive metabolic variations of Yang deficiency syndrome patients with HCC.
PMC3463959	D00012	The metabolites responsible for the separation of the YDS-HCC from the NYDS-HCC patients were structurally identified as LDL/VLDL, isoleucine, lactate, lipids, choline, and glucose/sugars.
PMC3463959	D00016	In _1 H-NMR serum profiling, lower intensities of LDL/VLDL, lipids, and choline in YDS-HCC than NYDS-HCC patients are correlated to lipid metabolism.
PMC3463959	D00017	LDL and VLDL play an important role in lipid metabolism as a transporter for cholesterol and triglyceride, respectively.
PMC3463959	D00019	Choline can increase fatty acid utilization and prevent abnormal accumulation of fat in liver.
PMC3463959	D00020	Choline is involved in the synthesis of creatine and indirectly involved in muscle energy metabolism.
PMC3463959	D00022	Lower intensities of LDL/VLDL, lipids, and choline in YDS-HCC patients implied the lower level of lipid metabolism in YDS-HCC patients.
PMC3463959	D00029	Lower levels of lipids, lipoproteins, and choline reflect the decrease of ability to use and reserve the lipid energy substances.
PMC3463959	D00030	It is also coincident with the results of lower level of lipids, lipoproteins, and choline in Yang deficiency syndrome patients in our study.
PMC3463959	D00032	In our examination, the differential metabolite involved in amino acid metabolism is isoleucine.
PMC3463959	D00033	Isoleucine, one of branched-chain amino acids, can synthesize protein for muscles and can transform into glucose for providing energy in the status of starvation or strenuous exercise.
PMC3463959	D00042	And low level of isoleucine might be one of potential biochemical characteristics for Yang deficiency syndrome patients with HCC.
PMC3463959	D00043	Glucose is the main source of energy for the human body and in a high-consuming status in tumors.
PMC3463959	D00044	Lactate is an important intermediate of anaerobic glycolysis in glucose metabolism.
PMC3463959	D00045	Lactate can send back to liver or muscle and convert into glcogen.
PMC3463959	D00046	In normal condition, anaerobic glycolysis is intensive in organs or cells with high energy-consuming or lacking of mitochondria, such as adrenal medulla, neurons, and blood red cells and can keep a stable lactate concentration in blood.
PMC3463959	D00048	Lactate is not only a metabolite of energy metabolism but also a kind of energy source for tumor cells.
PMC3463959	D00049	In our examination, the intensities of both glucose/sugar and lactate decreased in Yang deficiency syndrome patients with HCC.
PMC3463959	D00051	On the other hand, glucose/sugar, lactate, lipids, and amino acids are all the energy source, and these reduced metabolites might imply high consume of energy in Yang deficiency syndrome patients with HCC.

PMC3463959	M03000	All spectra were baseline corrected using multipoint baseline correction method, and chemical shifts were adjusted with reference to TPS.
PMC3463959	R00011	These resonances were structurally identified as low-density lipid/very low-density lipid (LDL/VLDL) (0.84 ppm, 0.92 ppm, 1.24 ppm, 1.28 ppm, 1.32 ppm), isoleucine (0.96 ppm), lactate (1.36 ppm, 1.40 ppm), lipids (2.00 ppm, 2.04 ppm), choline (3.24 ppm), and glucose/sugars (3.28 ppm, 3.40 ppm, 3.44 ppm, 3.48 ppm, 3.72 ppm, 3.84 ppm, 3.92 ppm).

PMC3513544	A00000	Impaired vitamin D metabolism may contribute to the development and progression of diabetic kidney disease.
PMC3513544	A01000	The aim of the study was to test associations of circulating vitamin D metabolites with risks of incident microalbuminuria, impaired glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and hypertension in type 1 diabetes.
PMC3513544	A02001	We measured plasma concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D
PMC3513544	A02002	[25(OH)D], 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by mass spectrometry at the end of the DCCT and tested associations with incident microalbuminuria, impaired GFR, and hypertension over up to 16 yr of EDIC follow-up.
PMC3513544	A03003	Low concentrations of 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, but not 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, were also associated with increased risk of microalbuminuria.
PMC3513544	A03004	No circulating vitamin D metabolite was associated with risk of impaired GFR or hypertension.
PMC3513544	A04000	Low plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D are associated with increased risk of microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes.
PMC3513544	A04001	In contrast, we did not find evidence linking impaired vitamin D metabolism to early GFR loss or the development of hypertension.
PMC3513544	A05002	Intensive glucose control can prevent kidney disease, and inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) can slow its progression (–).
PMC3513544	A05004	Impaired vitamin D metabolism may be a novel therapeutic target to prevent the development and progression of DKD.
PMC3513544	A05005	In animal models, including models of diabetic glomerulopathy, treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)_2 D; the active vitamin D hormone] or its analogs prevents albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, and progressive loss of kidney function (–).
PMC3513544	A05007	Among people with type 2 diabetes and urine albumin excretion of 100-3000 mg/g creatinine, 48 wk of treatment with paricalcitol, a 1,25(OH)_2 D analog, lowered albuminuria by 15%.
PMC3513544	A05008	However, long-term effects of vitamin D interventions in humans remain untested, and it is not clear whether there is renal benefit to supplement forms of vitamin, i.e. vitamin D_3 (cholecalciferol) and vitamin D_2 (ergocalciferol).
PMC3513544	A05009	Epidemiological studies demonstrate that low circulating concentrations of total 25-hydroxyvitamin D
PMC3513544	A05011	Such studies assessing vitamin D metabolism and DKD have been limited by cross-sectional design and measurement of single vitamin D metabolites.
PMC3513544	A05012	We measured circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)_2 D, and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [24,25 (OH)_2 D, the most abundant product of 25(OH)D catabolism] in a well-characterized type 1 diabetes population using novel mass spectrometry methods.
PMC3513544	A05013	We hypothesized that lower plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)_2 D, and 24,25(OH)_2 D—representing interrelated deficiencies in vitamin D intake, activation, and catabolism, respectively—would each be associated with increased risks of microalbuminuria, impaired GFR, and hypertension over long-term follow-up.
PMC3513544	D00000	Low plasma concentrations of 25(OH)D and 24,25 (OH)_2 D were associated with increased risks of developing new-onset microalbuminuria in a large and well-characterized type 1 diabetes population.
PMC3513544	D00001	Plasma 1,25(OH)_2 D concentration was not associated with risk of microalbuminuria, and no circulating vitamin D metabolite was associated with risk of impaired GFR, change in eGFR, or risk of hypertension.
PMC3513544	D00002	These results suggest that insufficient intake of vitamin D from cutaneous synthesis and oral consumption may increase the risk of microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes but do not support a role for impaired vitamin D metabolism in early GFR loss or the development of hypertension in this population.
PMC3513544	D00007	However, less frequent RAS inhibitor use cannot explain the observed associations of low 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)_2 D concentrations with greater microalbuminuria risk because it was slightly more frequent among participants with lower baseline vitamin D metabolite concentrations.
PMC3513544	D00010	Before widespread 25(OH)D screening or treatment, the long-term effects of vitamin D supplementation on diabetes complications should be evaluated in well-controlled clinical trials.
PMC3513544	D00011	Low plasma 24,25(OH)_2 D concentration was also associated with increased microalbuminuria risk, although this association was not as consistent as the association of low plasma
PMC3513544	D00013	As the primary product of 25(OH)D metabolism by CYP24A1, 24,25(OH)_2 D is a biomarker of 25(OH)D turnover.
PMC3513544	D00014	In a population with impaired GFR, 24,25 (OH)_2 D concentration was directly correlated with eGFR, suggesting that low 24,25(OH)_2 D concentration, alone or relative to 25(OH)D, reflects impairment of renal vitamin D metabolism.
PMC3513544	D00015	In the current study population, GFR was normal or high, and the correlation of 25(OH)D with 24,25(OH)_2 D was also high.
PMC3513544	D00016	In this setting, 24,25(OH)_2 D concentration appears to provide little information beyond 25(OH)D concentration.
PMC3513544	D00017	Interestingly, plasma 1,25(OH)_2 D concentration was not clearly associated with microalbuminuria risk.
PMC3513544	D00018	1,25(OH)_2 D is the potent hormonal form of vitamin D through which 25(OH)D would be expected to exert any biological effect.
PMC3513544	D00019	It is possible that local conversion of 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)_2 D results in beneficial autocrine or paracrine effects that are not captured by circulating 1,25(OH)_2 D concentration.
PMC3513544	D00020	Alternatively, circulating 1,25(OH)_2 D may be important for disease prevention, but inaccurate ascertainment of 1,25(OH)_2 D status may bias results to the null.
PMC3513544	D00021	Our assay measures plasma 1,25 (OH)_2 D more accurately and precisely than prior assays, but substantial misclassification may still result from the combination of short circulating half-life (8–12 h) and single time of measurement.
PMC3513544	D00022	Circulating vitamin D metabolites were not associated with risk of impaired GFR or change in eGFR in the present study.
PMC3513544	D00026	In contrast to prior studies (, ), circulating vitamin D metabolites were not significantly related to blood pressure in cross-section or to risk of hypertension during follow-up.
PMC3513544	D00027	It is possible that blood pressure in type 1 diabetes is so strongly influenced by other factors, such as glycemia and albuminuria, that marginal risk conferred by insufficient vitamin D is not relevant.
PMC3513544	D00030	Although our focus was on how circulating vitamin D metabolites affect risk of kidney disease, it is clear that kidney disease also determines vitamin D metabolism.
PMC3513544	D00031	To examine this, we described relationships of GFR (measured by iothalamate clearance) and AER with circulating vitamin D metabolites and related regulatory hormones in cross-sectional analyses.
PMC3513544	D00033	Within this range, there was no correlation of GFR with 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)_2 D, PTH, or FGF-23.
PMC3513544	D00034	There was a suggestion that 24,25(OH)_2 D concentrations were lower below a GFR threshold of approximately 120 ml/min/1.73
PMC3513544	D00035	m_2 , mirroring the positive correlation of eGFR with 24,25(OH)_2 D in the setting of impaired GFR and suggesting that impaired 25(OH)D catabolism may be an early sign of disturbed renal mineral metabolism in type 1 diabetes.
PMC3513544	D00036	Concentrations of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)_2 D, and 24,25(OH)_2 D were lower among the small number of participants with AER above 300 mg/24 h but did not correlate with AER when AER was less than 300 mg/24 h.
PMC3513544	D00037	It is possible that vitamin D metabolites are lost along with vitamin D binding protein with high levels of albuminuria.
PMC3513544	D00038	Strengths of this study include the assessment of a type 1 diabetes population at high risk of hypertension and kidney disease, large sample size, use of novel and specific mass spectrometry assays for three complementary circulating vitamin D metabolites, long duration of follow-up, use of detailed phenotype data to assess clinically important outcomes with confidence, and a combination of detailed baseline covariate data and a relatively homogenous study population that minimizes the risk of confounding.
PMC3513544	D00039	Limitations include the availability of vitamin D metabolite measurements at only one point in time.
PMC3513544	D00040	25(OH)D concentrations have been observed to be relatively stable within individuals over time, and our study was conducted during a period in which vitamin D supplementation was not common, but unmeasured changes in vitamin D metabolite concentrations over time could still lead to misclassification and bias results toward the null.
PMC3513544	D00042	As a result, we do not recommend routine measurements of circulating vitamin D metabolites or routine treatment with vitamin D on the basis of these results.
PMC3513544	D00043	This study supports further investigation into the use of vitamin D supplementation to prevent microalbuminuria in type 1 diabetes.
PMC3513544	D00044	We did not find evidence linking impaired vitamin D metabolism to early GFR loss or the development of hypertension.
PMC3513544	M00001	Participants were randomly assigned to intensive diabetes therapy aimed at lowering glucose concentrations as close as safely possible to the normal range or to conventional therapy aimed at preventing symptoms of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia.
PMC3513544	M01000	Concentrations of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)_2 D, and 24,25(OH)_2 D were measured in plasma samples that were obtained at or soon before the end of the DCCT.
PMC3513544	M01001	Plasma samples were stored continuously at −80 C. Vitamin D metabolites are known to be stable during long-term storage.

PMC3513544	M01004	Interassay imprecision was 4.40% at 10.4 ng/ml for 25(OH)D_3 , 4.35% at 9.7 ng/ml for 25(OH)D_2 , 9.6% at 33.2 pg/ml for 1,25(OH)_2 D_2 , 12.2% at 36.4 pg/ml for 1,25(OH)_2 D_3 , and 8.58% at 1.5 ng/ml for 24,25(OH)_2 D_3 .
PMC3513544	M01006	Plasma concentrations of intact PTH and fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) were measured in a subset of participants to describe their interrelationships with circulating vitamin D metabolites.
PMC3513544	M02000	Study outcomes included times from vitamin D specimen collection to development of persistent microalbuminuria, impaired GFR, and incident hypertension.
PMC3513544	M02005	Serum creatinine was measured yearly during DCCT and EDIC, and the Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology equation was used to estimate GFR.
PMC3513544	M03004	To increase precision, baseline AER for this study was calculated as the geometric mean of the AER measured concurrently with vitamin D metabolites and the AER preceding vitamin D measurement, usually by 1 yr.
PMC3513544	M03005	Data on vitamin D supplement use were not available.
PMC3513544	M04000	Correlations of circulating vitamin D metabolites with clinical characteristics and other biomarkers were assessed using Kendall's τ statistic.
PMC3513544	M04001	Associations of circulating vitamin D metabolites with time to study outcomes were assessed using Cox proportional hazards model.
PMC3513544	M04002	Time at risk began at the time vitamin D metabolites were measured.
PMC3513544	M04003	Participants with an outcome present at the time of vitamin D metabolite measurement (prevalent cases) were excluded from analyses of that outcome.
PMC3513544	M04005	We included outcome data from all study visits that occurred after measurement of vitamin D metabolites, including DCCT study visits when vitamin D metabolites were measured before DCCT closeout, through EDIC year 16 (September 2009 to April 2010).
PMC3513544	M04006	Because threshold concentrations of 25(OH)D may exist below which adequate conversion to 1,25(OH)_2 D cannot be maintained, plasma 25(OH)D concentrations were examined in categories associated with risk of clinically relevant disease outcomes in prior studies: 30 or greater, 20–29, and less than 20 ng/ml (, ).
PMC3513544	M04007	Because no such categories exist for 24,25 (OH)_2 D and 1,25(OH)_2 D, these metabolites were examined in quartiles.
PMC3513544	M04008	Adjusted hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were generated for each category of vitamin D metabolite, and P values were generated evaluating each vitamin D metabolite as a continuous variable.
PMC3513544	M04010	Generalized estimating equations were used to examine eGFR (intercept) and its change over time (slope) by categories of vitamin D metabolites.
PMC3513544	M04011	Models were adjusted for variables (measured at the time of plasma collection) that could confound associations of circulating vitamin D metabolites with study outcomes: age (continuous), sex, race (white vs. non-white), duration of diabetes (categories), DCCT treatment assignment (allowing separate baseline hazards in Cox models), season (May-October vs. November-April), solar irradiation of DCCT site (continuous), body mass index (continuous), AER (continuous), and eGFR
PMC3513544	R00003	At EDIC yr 1 and 16, use of RAS inhibitors (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers) was reported by 6.2 and 54.9% of participants, respectively, whereas use of calcium channel blockers was reported by 2.5 and 8.4% of participants, respectively.
PMC3513544	R00004	Throughout EDIC, the prevalence of RAS inhibitor use was similar or slightly higher for participants with lower baseline serum vitamin D metabolite concentrations (Supplemental Table 1, published on The Endocrine Society's Journals Online web site at http://jcem.endojournals.org).
PMC3513544	R00005	Clinical characteristics at the time of biomarker measurements (at or near the end of the DCCT) for all DCCT/EDIC participants with measurement of vitamin D metabolites (n = 1193) and for the subset of DCCT/EDIC participants with additional measurement of PTH and FGF-23 (n = 300) Cell contents are expressed as number (percentage) or mean (sd), except for AER, which is summarized as geometric mean (geometric sd).
PMC3513544	R01000	1,25(OH)_2 D correlated weakly with 25(OH)D (Kendall's τ = 0.16), whereas 24,25(OH)_2 D correlated strongly with both total 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D_3 (τ = 0.70 and τ = 0.73, respectively).
PMC3513544	R01001	25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)_2 D, and 1,25(OH)_2 D concentrations each correlated negatively with age and body mass index and were lower with non-white race.
PMC3513544	R01002	Women had lower mean 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)_2 D concentrations but higher mean 1,25 (OH)_2 D concentration.
PMC3513544	R01003	Participants assigned to DCCT intensive diabetes therapy had lower mean concentrations of 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)_2 D; these associations were attenuated and not statistically significant after adjustment for demographic variables, time from DCCT randomization, and body mass index at plasma collection and DCCT baseline (Supplemental Table 2).
PMC3513544	R01007	24,25(OH)_2 D concentrations tended to be lower below an iothalamate GFR of approximately 120 ml/min/1.73 m_2 , but other biomarkers did not vary significantly with GFR ( and Supplemental Fig. 2).
PMC3513544	R01008	Concentrations of 25(OH)D, 24,25(OH)_2 D, and 1,25(OH)_2 D did not vary with AER when AER was below 300 mg/24 h but tended to be lower with AER above 300 mg/24 h (Supplemental Fig.
PMC3513544	R01010	Concentrations of 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)_2 D but not 1,25(OH)_2 D correlated inversely with plasma PTH concentration (Supplemental Fig. 4).
PMC3513544	R01011	FGF-23 correlated negatively with 25(OH)D and 24,25(OH)_2 D and positively with 1,25(OH)_2 D.
PMC3513544	R02003	In comparison to 24,25(OH)_2 D of at least 5.3 ng/ml, participants with lower 24,25(OH)_2 D concentrations also had higher risks of microalbuminuria, but not in a monotonic fashion.
PMC3513544	R02004	Each 1 ng/ml decrement in 24,25(OH)_2 D was associated with a 7% higher risk of microalbuminuria, which was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval, 1% decreased risk to 16% increased risk; P = 0.09).
PMC3513544	R02005	Further adjustment for 25(OH)D concentration somewhat attenuated the association of 24,25(OH)_2 D with risk of microalbuminuria.
PMC3513544	R02006	Plasma 1,25(OH)_2 D concentration was not associated with risk of microalbuminuria.
PMC3513544	R02007	Associations of circulating vitamin D metabolites measured at the end of the DCCT with incident microalbuminuria, incident impaired GFR, and incident hypertension during the EDIC Study All models are adjusted for age, duration of diabetes, season, body mass index, AER, and eGFR at the time of biomarker measurement as well as sex, race, DCCT treatment assignment, and solar irradiation of DCCT clinic site.
PMC3513544	R02008	P values were generated evaluating each vitamin D metabolite as a continuous variable.

PMC3529819	R00025	Consequently, different types of organic solvent were investigated for the simultaneous enantioseparation of WAR and OH-WAR.
PMC3529819	R00026	Three polar protic solvents (MeOH, EtOH and IPA) and one polar aprotic solvent (ACN) were each added from 0–20% (v/v) to the BGE to find the most volume fraction.

PMC3529819	R00028	Several differences are noted when comparing ACN versus MeOH solvents.
PMC3529819	R00029	First, ACN provided similar peak shapes and efficiency but the run times were much faster compared to MeOH due to lower viscosity/dielectric constant ratio of the former solvent resulting in faster EOF.
PMC3529819	R00030	Second, the positional isomers of 6-OH-WAR were only partially resolved from 8-OH-WAR, and the optical resolution of optical isomer of 7-OH-WAR was much lower using ACN compared to MeOH.
PMC3529819	R00031	When the ACN or MeOH content exceeded 15% (v/v), the resolution of both optical and positional isomers of OH-WAR decreases (data not shown).
PMC3529819	R00032	Nevertheless, 15% (v/v) MeOH is the solvent of choice as it allows a better migration time difference between positional isomers of OH-WAR.

PMC3529819	R03000	Although simultaneous enantioseparation of WAR from the OH-WAR metabolites is required in MEKC-UV, it is not essential in MEKC-MS because different m/z of WAR and OH-WAR allows easy identification.
PMC3529819	R03001	For example, under optimized pH and organic solvent composition, one of the later eluting enantiomer of 6-OH-WAR the early enantiomer of WAR in total ion chromatogram (TIC) but both WAR and 6-OH-WAR can easily distinguishable in EIC mode.
PMC3529819	R03002	Nevertheless, simultaneous separation of all positional isomers of OH-WAR metabolites in MEKC-MS is of utmost importance due to same m/z .
PMC3529819	R03004	Conditions: buffer 25 mM NH_4 OAc/25 mM poly-L,L-SULV containing 15% (v/v) MeOH at pH 5.0.
PMC3529819	R03006	Encouraged by our earlier results on simultaneous enantioseparation of β-blockers, we attempted to explore the possibility of utilizing vancomycin as a packing material in combination with single-frit column to perform chiral CEC-MS of WAR and OH-WAR metabolites.
PMC3529819	R03007	Several mobile phase combinations of ACN and MeOH were tried Although the chiral selectivity for each hydroxylated metabolite (except 10-OH WAR) was very high, simultaneous separation of positional isomers by CEC-MS seems very challenging under both mobile phase conditions noted in .
PMC3529819	R03008	Clearly, the optical isomers of 10-OH-WAR was better separated using the mobile phase of ACN / H_2 O (45/55, v/v) containing 10 mM NH_4 OAc at pH 4.0 compared to the mobile composition of ACN / MeOH/ H_2 O (30/50/20, v/v/v).
PMC3529819	R03009	This is because both ACN and MeOH compete for hydrogen bonding sites on vancomycin CSP with the analytes.
PMC3529819	R03010	One possible explanation is that ACN is a relatively poor bonding donor than MeOH, the competition with the analyte for the hydrogen bonding sites on the CSP is less without MeOH in the mobile phase.
PMC3529819	R03011	Therefore, stereoisomers of 10-OH-WAR are able to bond more strongly to the CSP resulting in improved separation.
PMC3529819	R03012	Further decreasing the % ACN in the mobile phase, the Rs of 10-OH-WAR was not significantly improved, but the total run time of the CEC-ESI-MS was obviously increased due to the decrease of electroosmotic flow (data not shown).
PMC3529819	R03014	Attempts were also made to improve the resolution of six enantiomeric pairs using other organic solvent (i.e., isopropanol, butanol) (data not shown).
PMC3529819	R03017	Conditions: 40 cm long vancomycin packed column (total long 65 cm, 375 μm O.D. and 75 μm I.D.).
PMC3529819	R04000	Both single quadrupole MS and triple quadrupole MS were used to compare the S/N of the blank plasma spiked with WAR and its five -OH metabolites at a concentration of 1μg/mL. As shown in Fig.6A, the MEKC-MS provided a S/N of < 15 for a standard mixture of WAR and OH-WAR.
PMC3529819	R04001	However, the use of multiple reaction monitoring mode (i.e., MEKC-MS/MS, ) provided much higher S/N at the same injection size of 5 mbar for 2 s. For example, the S/N _avg  ~ 7 fold higher, i.e., 103 for WAR and ranged from 35 to 110 for OH-WAR.
PMC3529819	R04003	For example, the S/N _avg  ~ 300 fold higher, i.e., 5016 for 0.25 μg/mL for WAR and ranged from 350–1178 for 0.05 μg/mLof OH-WAR (data not shown).

PMC3529819	R05000	Although both coumachlor (COU) and diclofenac have been previously reported as I.S. for the analysis of WAR[, , ], diclofenac was chosen as I.S. for quantitation due to its shorter retention time compared to COU.
PMC3529819	R05001	Other reasons includes its easy accessibility, good SPE-MAX clean-up recovery (> 80%), better separation from WAR and OH-WAR metabolites as well as excellent ESI-MS response.

PMC3529819	R05007	The enantiomers of a standard mixture of WAR, its five OH-WARs and the I.S. were all best resolved within 45 min with high sensitivity.
PMC3529819	R05008	For each OH-WAR, the R and S - enantiomers were identified for the elution order of parent drug, WAR, which indicates R -enantiomer eluted first followed by the S -enantiomer.
PMC3529819	R05009	Traditional HPLC, which requires chiral and achiral columns for the separation of WAR and its OH-WAR metabolites is difficult due to too much back pressure generated at the required flow rate.

PMC3529819	R05021	Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) were previously compared for extractions of WAR and OH-WAR for human plasma samples.
PMC3529819	R05022	The extraction recoveries of WAR and 7-OH-WAR were less than 50% by LLE and relatively high (>80%) using MCX and MAX.
PMC3529819	R05025	For example, recoveries of WAR, 7-OH-WAR and I.S. were > 85 % using a combination of MAX cartridge and 4% (v/v) H_3 PO_4 (, middle column), which were significantly higher compared to the use of 10% (v/v) HClO_4 (, left column). .
PMC3529819	R05027	Therefore, the MAX cartridge with 4% (v/v) H_3 PO_4 as the deproteinized reagent was chosen as optimum combination to study recoveries of WAR, IS, and OH-WAR at three different concentration levels (i.e. 25, 100, and 500 ng/mL) in human plasma.
PMC3529819	R05028	The recoveries were between 90.1 – 110.7 % for WAR, and 85.2 – 112.9 % for OH-WARs with the RSDs between 5.3 and 8.7 %.
PMC3529819	R05029	Comparison of recovery using three different solid phase extraction (SPE) methods To determine the concentration of WAR and OH-WAR metabolites in patients' plasma samples, chiral MEKC-ESI-MS/MS was applied to develop a chiral assay.
PMC3529819	R05030	Under the optimum conditions, the simultaneous determination of WAR and OH-WAR was examined by generating calibration plots of all enantiomers in blank plasma.
PMC3529819	R05031	The calibration curves displayed good linearity in the range of 2–5000 ng/mL for R - and S -warfarin (r_2 = 0.9993–0.996), 5–1000 ng/mL for R - and S -6-,

PMC3529819	R05053	As expected, for the same subject, there is much lower peak height of R -7-OH-WAR compared to S -7-OH WAR (i.e. R<S).
PMC3529819	R05054	Although the peak height ratio of R/S -WAR is reversed in mutant subject (patient 5, right electrochromatogram), the trend in R/S ratio for OH-WAR metabolites remains is not reversed.
PMC3529819	R05057	For all 55 patients' plasma samples, 8-OH-WAR was observed in 15% of these patients, but was below the LOQ.
PMC3529819	R05058	Plasma concentrations of R -4'-OH-WAR, R -7-OH-WAR, S -6-OH-WAR and S -10-OH-WAR were above the LOQ in 5%, 11%, 24% and 4% of these 55 subjects, respectively.
PMC3529819	R05059	Nevertheless, R -6-OH-WAR, R -10-OH-WAR, S -4'-OH-WAR and S -7-OH-WAR were able to be quantified in 85%, 95%, 95% and 98% of these 55 subjects, respectively.
PMC3529819	R05060	In 95% and 4% of these patients, the major observed metabolites were S -7-OH-WAR and R -10-OH-WAR confirming that the formation of these two major isomers are catalyzed by human CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, respectively.
PMC3529819	R05061	The formation of metabolites of S -WAR decreases in the order 7-OH ≫ 4'-OH ~ 6-OH > 10-OH ~ 8-OH (Table S1) suggesting that S -WAR is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 to 7-OH-WAR.
PMC3529819	R05062	The mean plasma concentrations of R -OH-WAR are ranked in the following order: 10-OH > 6-OH ~ 7-OH ~ 4'-OH ~ 8-OH (Table S1) confirming that R -WAR is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 to 10-OH-WAR.
PMC3529819	R05064	For example, the concentration of 4-OH-WAR and 7-OH-WAR have the order of R <S , whereas 6-OH-WAR and 10-OH-WAR have the order of R >S (Table S1, and ).
PMC3529819	R05068	In a previous study, only the racemic forms of OH-WAR enantiomers were quantified among 204 patients undergoing warfarin therapy.
PMC3529819	R05069	In addition, racemic 7-OH WAR and 10-OH WAR were major plasma metabolites, while 4'-OH-WAR was undetectable in all patients.
PMC3529819	R05070	This novel chiral MEKC-ESI-MS/MS method allowed quantitation of R -4'-OH-WAR and S -4'-OH-WAR in 5% and 95% of the plasma samples, respectively, which was not observed in the study by Locatelli and Jones.

PMC3529819	R07007	The recoveries were between 90.1 – 110.7 % for WAR, and 85.2 – 112.9 % for OH-WARs with the RSDs between 5.3 and 8.7 %.
PMC3529819	R07008	Comparison of recovery using three different solid phase extraction (SPE) methods To determine the concentration of WAR and OH-WAR metabolites in patients' plasma samples, chiral MEKC-ESI-MS/MS was applied to develop a chiral assay.
PMC3529819	R07009	Under the optimum conditions, the simultaneous determination of WAR and OH-WAR was examined by generating calibration plots of all enantiomers in blank plasma.
PMC3529819	R07010	The calibration curves displayed good linearity in the range of 2–5000 ng/mL for R - and S -warfarin (r_2 = 0.9993–0.996), 5–1000 ng/mL for R - and S -6-,

PMC3529819	R08000	The developed chiral MEKC-ESI-MS/MS assay was next applied to the simultaneous determination of concentrations of WAR and OH-WAR in plasma samples obtained for a total of 55 patients.
PMC3529819	R08011	As expected, for the same subject, there is much lower peak height of R -7-OH-WAR compared to S -7-OH WAR (i.e. R<S).
PMC3529819	R08012	Although the peak height ratio of R/S -WAR is reversed in mutant subject (patient 5, right electrochromatogram), the trend in R/S ratio for OH-WAR metabolites remains is not reversed.
PMC3529819	R08015	For all 55 patients' plasma samples, 8-OH-WAR was observed in 15% of these patients, but was below the LOQ.
PMC3529819	R08016	Plasma concentrations of R -4'-OH-WAR, R -7-OH-WAR, S -6-OH-WAR and S -10-OH-WAR were above the LOQ in 5%, 11%, 24% and 4% of these 55 subjects, respectively.
PMC3529819	R08017	Nevertheless, R -6-OH-WAR, R -10-OH-WAR, S -4'-OH-WAR and S -7-OH-WAR were able to be quantified in 85%, 95%, 95% and 98% of these 55 subjects, respectively.
PMC3529819	R08018	In 95% and 4% of these patients, the major observed metabolites were S -7-OH-WAR and R -10-OH-WAR confirming that the formation of these two major isomers are catalyzed by human CYP2C9 and CYP3A4, respectively.
PMC3529819	R08019	The formation of metabolites of S -WAR decreases in the order 7-OH ≫ 4'-OH ~ 6-OH > 10-OH ~ 8-OH (Table S1) suggesting that S -WAR is metabolized primarily by CYP2C9 to 7-OH-WAR.
PMC3529819	R08020	The mean plasma concentrations of R -OH-WAR are ranked in the following order: 10-OH > 6-OH ~ 7-OH ~ 4'-OH ~ 8-OH (Table S1) confirming that R -WAR is metabolized primarily by CYP3A4 to 10-OH-WAR.
PMC3529819	R08022	For example, the concentration of 4-OH-WAR and 7-OH-WAR have the order of R <S , whereas 6-OH-WAR and 10-OH-WAR have the order of R >S (Table S1, and ).
PMC3529819	R08026	In a previous study, only the racemic forms of OH-WAR enantiomers were quantified among 204 patients undergoing warfarin therapy.
PMC3529819	R08027	In addition, racemic 7-OH WAR and 10-OH WAR were major plasma metabolites, while 4'-OH-WAR was undetectable in all patients.
PMC3529819	R08028	This novel chiral MEKC-ESI-MS/MS method allowed quantitation of R -4'-OH-WAR and S -4'-OH-WAR in 5% and 95% of the plasma samples, respectively, which was not observed in the study by Locatelli and Jones.
PMC3573235	A00002	We report the development and validation of a novel method to directly measure the urinary concentrations of the conjugated metabolites of vitamin E (α-tocopherol) and investigate whether the oxidized metabolite α-tocopheronolactone (α-TL) could be used as a biomarker of oxidative stress in children with type 1 diabetes.
PMC3573235	A00003	A novel method using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry was developed and used to measure directly and rapidly the urinary concentrations of the glucuronidated and sulfated metabolites of α-tocopherol in 32 young patients with type 1 diabetes and age-matched controls.
PMC3573235	A00004	The mean concentrations of the glucuronidated and sulfated conjugates of α-TL were all highly significantly increased in the children with type 1 diabetes (p <0.001).
PMC3573235	A00005	The results suggest that the measurement of the urinary concentrations of α-TL conjugates may provide a useful biomarker of oxidative stress in diabetes and possibly in other clinical conditions in which oxidative stress has been implicated.

PMC3573235	D00000	The method described in this paper using LC–MS/MS for the direct measurement of the conjugated metabolites of vitamin E is novel as previous methods used gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) and were able to analyze only the free unconjugated metabolites.
PMC3573235	D00007	In contrast artifactual formation of α-TL from free α-CEHC can occur during the assay of the free metabolites .
PMC3573235	D00008	It would have been ideal to use deuterated conjugated vitamin E metabolites as internal standards for this study but this was not possible.
PMC3573235	D00009	Thus type II internal standards (androsterone glucuronide and lithocholic acid sulfate) were used.
PMC3573235	D00010	We have established and validated a simple, fast, and reproducible assay for directly quantitating the urinary conjugated vitamin E metabolites and shown unequivocally for the first time that conjugates of α-TL were real metabolites and not artifacts of the methodological procedure.
PMC3573235	D00011	Thus it was possible to investigate whether conjugated α-TL could be used as a biomarker of oxidative stress.
PMC3573235	D00012	The hypothesis put forward in this study was that the urinary concentrations of α-TL (sulfate and glucuronide) would be greater in patients with diabetes compared to age-matched controls, with less change in the concentrations of conjugated α-CEHC.
PMC3573235	D00013	The total urinary concentrations of all the metabolites (sulfate and glucuronide) were found to be greater, by a factor of approximately 8, in the children with diabetes compared to their age-matched controls, with the total concentration of α-TL (glucuronide and sulfate) being approximately 15 times greater and the total α-CEHC (glucuronide and sulfate) being 2 times greater than in the control subjects.
PMC3573235	D00014	The ratio of α-TL:α-CEHC was approximately 7 in the cohort with diabetes compared to 0.9 in the controls.
PMC3573235	D00015	When the individual conjugated metabolites were compared in the two groups, the mean concentrations of the conjugated α-TL metabolites in the patients with diabetes were all highly significantly increased (p <0.001) compared to the controls, whereas the α-CEHC conjugates were not increased to the same degree of significance (p <0.05).
PMC3573235	D00017	Although plasma concentrations of α-tocopherol were not compared in the two groups, these results suggest an increased metabolism of vitamin E in patients with diabetes compared to controls, with oxidation of α-tocopherol being more prominent than chain shortening.
PMC3573235	D00018	This is compatible with an increase in oxidative stress in diabetes and suggests that conjugated α-TL may be a useful biomarker.
PMC3573235	D00020	There was also no significant correlation between the concentrations of the α-TL conjugates and the HbA1c levels in all the diabetic patients.
PMC3573235	D00022	To examine this further it will be necessary to follow a larger cohort of patients with diabetes longitudinally and compare urinary concentrations of conjugated α-TL with other well-recognized measures of diabetes control, such as HbA1c and urinary albumin concentrations.
PMC3573235	D00025	that α-TL could be an indicator/biomarker of oxidative stress but the nature of the relationship between clinical severity of diabetes and oxidative stress status requires further investigation.
PMC3573235	D00026	We have no ready explanation as to why the children with type 1 diabetes excreted increased urinary concentrations of the conjugated vitamin E metabolites compared to the controls.
PMC3573235	D00027	They were not receiving any vitamin E supplementation or pharmacological therapy at the time of the study.
PMC3573235	D00028	We can only speculate that an increase in metabolism of vitamin E and particularly oxidation occurs as a result of the underlying condition.
PMC3573235	D00029	It is, however, of interest that a link between vitamin E and glucose metabolism has been reported .
PMC3573235	D00030	In particular it was found that when mice deficient for the α-tocopherol transport protein (α-TTP) were supplemented with α-tocopherol there was an increase in their glucose tolerance.
PMC3573235	D00031	The liver, and in particular the hepatic α-TTP, has a key role in discriminating between the various forms of vitamin E by loading α-tocopherol onto very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and thereby maintaining plasma and tissue α-tocopherol concentrations (see Traber et al. ).
PMC3573235	D00032	Presumably those forms of vitamin E including metabolites of α-tocopherol that are not loaded onto VLDL are preferentially excreted.
PMC3573235	D00033	The concentrations of the glucuronide metabolites were greater than the sulfates in both the cohorts, with the glucuronide:sulfate ratio being approximately 8 in patients with diabetes and 3 in the controls.
PMC3573235	D00035	Similar observations of preferential glucuronidation of the vitamin E metabolites were made by Pope when he conducted LC–MS/MS analysis on normal human urine .
PMC3573235	D00037	Thus Dandona et al. observed an approximately fourfold greater concentration of 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine in mononuclear cells of patients with diabetes compared to corresponding controls.
PMC3573235	D00039	Davi et al. were the first group to demonstrate that the increased 8-epi-PGF2α observed in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients could be normalized by vitamin E supplementation.
PMC3573235	D00040	Leonhardt et al. had previously reported elevated levels of oxidized LDL and decreased concentrations of RRR -α-tocopherol in the plasma of patients with diabetes compared to healthy controls, making a case for investigating the role of vitamin E metabolites in diabetes.
PMC3573235	D00041	Others have reported reduced concentrations of antioxidants including vitamin E in diabetes (see ), and the role of vitamin E and oxidative stress in diabetes has recently been reviewed .
PMC3573235	D00042	To fully validate the use of urinary conjugates of α-TL as a potential biomarker of oxidative stress, it will be necessary to synthesize the deuterated conjugates of α-TL and α-CEHC to use them as internal standards for the assay in place of the current type II internal standards (androsterone glucuronide and lithocholic acid sulfate) and to carry out the following additional studies.
PMC3573235	D00043	First, prospective longitudinal studies of urinary vitamin E metabolites will be required in subjects with diabetes, comparing the excretion of α-TL conjugates with other parameters of diabetic control such as plasma HbA1c and urinary albumin concentrations.
PMC3573235	D00044	Second, urinary concentrations of α-TL conjugates will need to be compared with other biomarkers of oxidative stress such as urinary isoprostanes.
PMC3573235	D00045	Finally, it will be important to investigate the urinary concentrations of α-TL conjugates in other conditions in which oxidative stress has been implicated.
PMC3573235	M00000	The sulfated and glucuronidated conjugates of α-TL and α-CEHC used in the method development and validation studies were synthesized by Pope et al. .
PMC3573235	M00001	The vitamin E metabolites were analyzed by mass spectrometry using a triple-quadrupole Micro Quattro instrument (MicroMass, Waters, UK) fitted with an electrospray ionization source.

PMC3573235	M00008	[M−H_− ] (C and D) corresponded to the theoretical masses of α-CEHC and α-TL glucuronide.
PMC3573235	M00009	α-CEHC and α-TL have the same molecular masses and are, therefore, isobaric.
PMC3573235	M00010	Parent ion scans of vitamin E metabolites.
PMC3573235	M00012	The fragmentation analysis for the sulfate metabolites was observed in a scan mode of 2–400 m/z (A and B).
PMC3573235	M00013	The fragmentation pattern of α-CEHC sulfate led to a “fingerprint” ion identified as a sulfite ion (SO_3 _− ) with an intensity of 79.7 m/z. Lesser intensity ions were observed at 276.9, 243.1, 233.1, and 163.1 m/z, which were attributed to the fragmentation of the metabolite as shown in A. Fragmentation analysis of α-TL sulfate (B) revealed the presence of a progeny and lesser intensity ions similar to that of the α-CEHC sulfate, except no ion at 243.1 m/z was observed.
PMC3573235	M00014	Product ion scans of vitamin E metabolites.

PMC3573235	M00016	z. The highest intensity ion was observed at 112.8 m/z (C and D), which was formed by the loss of H_2 O and CO_2 from the glucuronide moiety.
PMC3573235	M00018	The fragmentations of the α-CEHC and α-TL glucuronides were very similar and thus the two metabolites could not be differentiated by mass spectral analysis alone.
PMC3573235	M00021	Masses were observed at 455.3 and 465.3 m/z [M−H_− ], which were consistent with the internal standards lithocholic acid sulfate and androsterone glucuronide, respectively (not shown).
PMC3573235	M00023	This led to the identification of a daughter ion (HSO_4 ) of lithocholic acid sulfate at 97 m/z and a daughter ion of androsterone glucuronide at 112.8 m/z. Because of the isobaric nature of α-CEHC and α-TL and their similar fragmentation patterns (with the exception of an ion at 243.1 m/z in the case of α-CEHC sulfate), high performance liquid chromatography was used together with tandem mass spectrometry to determine if it was possible to distinguish each vitamin E metabolite by its chromatographic retention time in addition to mass spectral analysis.
PMC3573235	M00026	Two peaks were observed for the α-TL glucuronide, a major peak eluting at 8.37 min and a minor one at 10.56 min.
PMC3573235	M00028	These major and minor peaks are referred to as α-TL glucuronide 1 and 2, respectively.

PMC3590212	D00034	Furthermore, we depicted specific changes in the longevity phenotype in arachidonic acid synthesis (, ), key mediator of immune and inflammatory reactions.
PMC3590212	D00035	Here we discerned higher concentration of leukotriene 4 (LTE-4), which plays a pivotal role in allergic and inflammatory diseases, causing increased vascular permeability and vasodilatation .
PMC3590212	D00036	Centenarians displayed higher circulating levels of 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), a major product of 15-lipoxygenase (15-LOX) enzyme, known for its anti-inflammatory properties .
PMC3590212	D00037	Increased activation of cytochrome P450 pathway in centenarians is further supported by increased circulating levels of 8,9-epoxyeicosatrienoic (8,9-EpETrE) and decreased concentration of 11,12-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (11,12-DiHETrE).
PMC3590212	D00040	EpETrEs can be further metabolized by soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) to dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acids (DiHETrE), reducing their original biological activity.
PMC3590212	D00041	Therefore, the decreased concentration of 11,12-DiHETrE might reveal decreased sEH's effect on its precursor 11,12-EpETrE. Most important, centenarians displayed lower circulating levels of 9-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), a biological active molecule, marker of lipid peroxidation, and in 9-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (9-oxo-HODE), a stable oxidation product of linoleic acid, the generations of which is increased with increasing oxidative stress .
PMC3590212	D00042	Previous studies determined the positive relationship among lower 9-HODE concentrations and Mediterranean diet to reduced cardiovascular disease risk , and our results might underpin this trend, while at the same time revealing decreased oxidative damage in centenarians.
PMC3590212	D00043	Increased levels of lipid oxidation products such as 9-oxoODE are normally detected in plasma samples of patients suffering rheumatoid arthritis , and arthrosclerosis .
PMC3590212	D00045	Our findings on the increased concentration of 8,9-EpETrE, suggesting increased activity of CYP enzyme, would support promotion of cellular detoxification mechanisms through specific modulation of the arachidonic acid metabolic cascade in centenarians.
PMC3590212	D00046	Such effective mechanism might results in the activation and successful antioxidative response, as displayed by the decreased concentration of 9-HODE, and 9-oxoODE in centenarians.
PMC3590212	D00047	Compared to elderly, centenarians also presented depletion of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 fatty acid, which can be synthesized in humans from alpha-linoleic acid or in greater amount directly from oily fishes.
PMC3590212	D00048	Importantly, EPA exerts anti-inflammatory effects mostly by increasing the biosynthesis of beneficial ω-3 eicosanoids, resolvins .
PMC3590212	D00051	In our study urine metabolic profiling revealed that the longevity phenotype is affected by significant changes in the gut microbiome as displayed by increased excretion of PCS and PAG (, ) in centenarians compared to elderly.
PMC3590212	D00052	Our findings support the initial hypothesis suggesting that late aging process might lead to increase p -cresol production, driven by age-related changes in the composition of the gut bacteria .
PMC3590212	D00053	Gut microbiota extensively catabolized protein and aromatic amino acids, including phenylalanine and tyrosine, to form PAG and PCS .
PMC3590212	D00054	Moreover, centenarians display increased concentration of 2-HB a compound present in most fruits and vegetables, with anti-inflammatory activity and with known capabilities to inhibit transcription of cyclooxygenase-2, an enzyme that catalyses the formation of prostaglandins during inflammation .
PMC3590212	D00055	Lastly, we assessed the relationships between urine metabotypes and microbiota composition correlating the three markers of longevity (PAG, PCS, 2-HB) with phylogenetic bacterial groups.
PMC3590212	D00056	PAG displays positive correlation with Proteobacteria species, namely Campylobacter , E. coli , Haemophilus , Pseudomonas , Serratia , Yersinia et rel , while both PCS and PAG correlating to Vibrio .
PMC3590212	D00057	Although it has been reported that some species of Clostridia produce phenol and p-cresol together with ammonia and hydrogen by anaerobic degradation of aromatic amino acids , our data suggest that Proteobacteria might also contribute to the pool of PAG and PCS.
PMC3590212	D00059	Of particular interest is the negative correlation of PAG and PCS with several butyrate-producing bacteria belonging to Clostridium cluster XIVa species, namely Butyrivibrio crossotus et rel.

PMC3590212	R00002	As expected, centenarians were characterized by a number of significant differences regarding a variety of parameters (, BMI p<0.001, HOMA p<0.001, total cholesterol p<0.01, triglycerides p<0.05, HDL p<0.01, LDL p<0.01, A-SAA p<0.001, and CRP p<0.001 among others) in comparison to elderly (including offspring of centenarians and offspring of non long-lived parents) and young subjects.
PMC3590212	R01001	We performed multivariate data analysis using Random Forest (RF™) on pre processed semi-quantitative data on the given 160 metabolites (amino acids, sugars, acyl-carnitines, sphingolipids, and glycerophospholipids).
PMC3590212	R01004	While the overall concentration of glycerolphospholipids and sphingolipids increased and decreased depending on the fatty acid composition, we identified three distinct metabolic patterns : (i) set of compounds that that monotonically increased or decreased (statistically significant) with age (, ), likely representing metabolic signatures of the aging process, such as decreased concentrations of Tryptophan (Trp), lysophospatidylcholines (LPC 18∶2, LPC 20∶4), increased levels of PC 32∶0 and sphingomyelins (SM 24∶1, SM 16∶0); (ii) a set of compounds remaining largely unchanged until age 70 and undergoing significant changes in centenarians (, ), characterized by a complex pattern of decreased concentration in sphingomyelins and specific glycerophospholipids (SM-OH 22∶1, LPC 18∶0, SM 24∶0, PC-O 34∶3, PC-O 36∶4, PC-O 40∶1, PC 36∶2) and increased concentration in specific glycerophospholipids (PC-O 32∶1, PC-O 34∶1); (iii) set of compounds which changes in the elderly, but is remarkably similar in young subjects and centenarians, (, ), putatively representing the metabolic phenotype of longevity, characterized by an increased concentration of specific glycerophospholipids (PC34∶4, PC36∶6, PC 36∶5, PC 38∶4, PC 38∶6, PC 40∶6, PC-O 38∶0, PC-O 38∶6).
PMC3590212	R01012	To further investigate the centenarian's response to immune and inflammatory processes we performed a quantitative LC-MS/MS eicosanoids profiling on serum samples from a restricted number of 12 centenarians, 37 elderly and 18 young subjects.
PMC3590212	R01014	Specifically, centenarians exhibit lower concentration of 11,12-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid (11,12-DiHETrE), 9-hydroxy-octadecadienoic acid (9-HODE), and 9-oxo-octadecadienoic acid (9-oxo-HODE), and increased concentrations of 15-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE), and leukotriene E4 (LTE4).
PMC3590212	R01015	Compared to elderly levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) decreased also in centenarians.
PMC3590212	R01016	Furthermore, to maximize metabolic changes between centenarians and elderly, we applied pair-wise Multiple Regression/Correlation (MRC) analysis between these two age groups displaying increased serum concentration levels of 8,9-epoxyeicosatrienoic (8,9-EET) in centenarians.
PMC3590212	R01020	Lastly, we have reported concentration values for the selected metabolites of interest for female and male individuals in both global metabonomic and eicosanoids analysis.
PMC3590212	R01022	For targeted eicosanoids analysis the majority of samples represent females individuals, therefore the displayed statistical differences remain when looking only in females, while in males, as the number among centenarians is very low, and we report their values with the overall metabolic changes kept, it is worth to mention that this leads to limited statistical power.
PMC3590212	R02001	Here, we underpinned in centenarian's offspring (46 subjects, average age 68.4), compared to offspring of non long-lived parents (44 subjects, average age 70.5) (, ), higher concentrations of specific lysophospatidylcholines (LPC 16∶0, LPC 16∶1, LPC 18∶0, LPC 18∶1, LPC 18∶2), glycerophospholipids (PC-O 36∶3) and two amino acids (serine, phenylalanine).
PMC3590212	R02002	In the measured eicosanoids panel, no metabolic differences were noted among centenarians' offspring (17 subjects, average age 66.3) and offspring of non long-lived parents (20 subjects, average age 73.1).
PMC3590212	R03003	Interpretation of the O-PLS-DA regression coefficients for the first latent component , displayed higher levels of phenylacetylglutamine (PAG), p-cresol-sulfate (PCS), and 2-Hydroxybenzoate (2-HB) in centenarians compared to elderly.
PMC3590212	R03005	Lastly, we have reported values for three metabolites of interests in urine in females and males individuals, displaying no gender differences for PAG, PCS, 2-HB (, ).

PMC3637650	A00002	We assessed how alterations in the metabolite levels were related to the World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grades, tumor location, gadolinium enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and the isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH ) mutation status.
PMC3637650	A00004	The citric and isocitric acid levels were significantly higher in the glioblastoma (GBM) samples than in the grades I–II and grade III glioma samples.
PMC3637650	A00005	In addition, the lactic and 2-aminopimelic acid levels were relatively higher in the GBM samples than in the grades I–II glioma samples.
PMC3637650	A00006	The CSF levels of the citric, isocitric, and lactic acids were significantly higher in grade I–III gliomas with mutant IDH than in those with wild-type IDH .
PMC3637650	A00008	Higher CSF levels of lactic acid were statistically associated with a poorer prognosis in grades III–IV malignant gliomas.
PMC3637650	A02000	Metabolome, Glioma, Cerebrospinal fluid, Lactic acid, Citric acid, Isocitrate dehydrogenase
PMC3637650	D00000	Metabolic remodeling is a predominant phenotype of malignant tumor cells (Warburg effect) and refers to the alteration of the utilization and/or synthesis of important metabolites, including glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids, by tumor cells.
PMC3637650	D00002	The 13C-nuclear MR spectroscopy measurements have demonstrated that glioblastoma cells convert as much as 90 % of the glucose that they acquire into lactic acid in vitro.
PMC3637650	D00003	Clinically, it is known that the levels of several metabolites, such as choline and lactic acid, are elevated in malignant glioma tissue compared with contralateral normal brain tissue.
PMC3637650	D00004	Additionally, lactic acid levels are higher in grades III and IV gliomas than in low-grade gliomas, and lipids are significantly elevated in grade IV gliomas.
PMC3637650	D00005	Additionally, Colavolpe reported that malignant glioma cells absorb a large quantity of F18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) and that pre-treatment with FDG-PET provides significant additional prognostic information for high-grade gliomas.
PMC3637650	D00006	Thus, glioma cells have different metabolic patterns in terms of utilizing important metabolites such as glucose and fatty acids when compared with normal glial cells or among different WHO grades.
PMC3637650	D00009	The lactic acid level in the CSF was significantly elevated in the GBMs compared with the grades I–II gliomas.
PMC3637650	D00010	Lactic acid is often more prominent in the highest grade of glioma in MRS studies.
PMC3637650	D00011	Furthermore, Yamasaki et al. reported that lactic acid expression in glioma statistically correlated with a shorter OS among the MRS parameters.
PMC3637650	D00012	Consistent with their results, the higher CSF level of lactic acid tended to be associated with a shorter OS in all glioma patients and was statistically associated with a shorter OS in malignant glioma alone in our metabolomic study.
PMC3637650	D00013	Interestingly, the present study demonstrated that the CSF levels of lactic acid were significantly increased in gliomas with a mutant IDH compared with wild-type IDH in only low-grade gliomas (grades I–III).
PMC3637650	D00014	We sought to determine whether the higher lactic acid levels were associated with a poor outcome in grade I–III gliomas.
PMC3637650	D00016	Although gliomas with a mutant IDH are known to be associated with improved survival, further studies are required to determine the association between the CSF lactic acid levels and the prognosis in low-grade gliomas.
PMC3637650	D00017	Lactic acid is produced by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and is usually an anaerobic metabolic product that occurs when the oxygen demand of a rapidly growing tumor exceeds what its neovasculature supplies.
PMC3637650	D00018	In addition, unlike most normal tissues, malignant tumor cells convert most glucose into lactic acid, regardless of whether oxygen is available to support mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
PMC3637650	D00019	Active glycolysis increases the cytosolic NADH/NAD_+ ratio and thereby accelerates lactate dehydrogenase activity.
PMC3637650	D00023	From these findings, tumor cells, particularly hypoxic tumor cells, seem to predominantly produce and release lactic acid.
PMC3637650	D00025	This is consistent with the CSF lactic acid level.
PMC3637650	D00026	Thus, the CSF lactic acid level appears to reflect the metabolic condition of the glioma tissues.
PMC3637650	D00027	The CSF levels of citric and isocitric acid, which are TCA cycle metabolites, were significantly elevated in GBMs compared with grades I–II or III gliomas.
PMC3637650	D00028	Citric acid accumulates in tissue in which the glycolytic rate exceeds the TCA cycle activity.
PMC3637650	D00029	Furthermore, it is well known that citric acid is required to produce cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA for lipid synthesis, and this step is essential to support cell growth [, ].
PMC3637650	D00030	In an MRS study of gliomas, citric acid levels were reported to be high in pediatric pontine gliomas.
PMC3637650	D00031	In addition, citric acid levels were higher in aggressive pediatric astrocytomas than in indolent astrocytomas.
PMC3637650	D00032	Based on this evidence, it appears that high-grade gliomas have higher levels of citric acid than low-grade gliomas.
PMC3637650	D00033	In the present study, the higher CSF level of citric acid tended to be associated with a shorter OS in all glioma patients.
PMC3637650	D00034	Thus, measuring the amount of CSF citric acid may be useful for predicting the prognosis of gliomas.
PMC3637650	D00037	Reitman et al. reported that amino acid, choline lipid, and TCA cycle metabolite levels were altered in cells expressing IDH mutants.
PMC3637650	D00038	They described that the late TCA intermediates fumarate and malate were reduced in IDH mutant-expressing cells.
PMC3637650	D00039	Additionally, Lazovic et al. recently reported that the ratio of lactate/choline was significantly increased in IDH1R132H-transfected U87 cells compared with control cells in an MRS study.
PMC3637650	D00043	In contrast, the CSF concentrations of lactic, citric, and isocitric acid were significantly higher in gliomas with IDH mutations compared with those of a wild-type IDH .
PMC3637650	D00044	In addition, the levels of the late TCA cycle metabolites that act downstream of isocitric acid decreased in the gliomas with IDH mutations.
PMC3637650	D00045	IDH1 converts isocitrate into α-ketoglutarate, which may explain the observed lower levels of late TCA metabolites (which are downstream from α-ketoglutarate) and increased isocitrate, pyruvate, and/or citrate levels (which are upstream from isocitrate).
PMC3637650	D00047	Recently, biochemical studies revealed that mutant IDH1 protein gains the function to catalyze the reduction of α-ketoglutarate to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) in a NADPH-consuming manner.
PMC3637650	D00048	Sahm et al. reported the success of the detection of 2-HG in glioma tissue using GC/MS.
PMC3637650	D00049	However, our study, which used the GCMS-QP2010 Ultra and Plus, did not detect 2-HG in the CSF of the glioma patients with the IDH mutation.
PMC3637650	D00050	Further studies are required to detect 2-HG in the CSF of glioma patients.
PMC3637650	D00062	In conclusion, the CSF levels of several metabolites, such as citric, isocitric, and lactic acid, were altered between glioma grades and the IDH mutation status, which may reflect the glioma cell metabolism.

PMC3637650	R00011	In addition, the citric and isocitric acid levels were significantly increased in GBMs compared with the levels observed in anaplastic astrocytomas (citric acid: p  = 0.033, Q =

PMC3637650	R00015	The concentration of downstream molecules of isocitric acid in the TCA cycle, i.e., succinic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid, were relatively lower in GBMs than in grades I-II or III gliomas (Supplementary Table S1).
PMC3637650	R00025	The levels of lactic acid (1.21-fold, p  = 0.033) and 2-aminopimelic acid (1.87-fold, p  = 0.042) were higher in GBMs than in grades I–II gliomas (Fig.
PMC3637650	R00027	However, a high Q-value indicated that these differences were not significant (lactic acid: Q-value = 0.955, 2-aminopimelic acid: Q-value = 0.955).
PMC3637650	R01000	To determine the source of the increased levels of lactic acid, we examined the expression of LDHA (lactate dehydrogenase-A), which produces lactic acid from pyruvate, in all glioma samples analyzed.
PMC3637650	R01005	From these findings, tumor cells, particularly hypoxic tumor cells, appear to predominantly produce and release lactic acid.
PMC3637650	R01008	This finding is consistent with the results demonstrated for the CSF lactic acid levels.
PMC3637650	R01012	Although the sample number of the 1H-MRS studies was small, the lactic acid concentrations in the CSF correlated with the level of lactic acid in the tumor using 1H-MRS (Supplementary Fig.
PMC3637650	R01014	Therefore, the CSF lactic acid level appears to reflect the metabolic condition of the glioma cells.
PMC3637650	R01015	Conversely, citric and isocitric acids were not clearly detected in our MRS study.
PMC3637650	R02003	In high-grade gliomas alone, however, the CSF citric and isocitric acid levels were relatively higher in gliomas proximally located to the ventricle than in those distally located to the ventricle (citric acid: p  = 0.075, isocitric acid: p  = 0.075).
PMC3637650	R02004	Conversely, in low-grade gliomas alone, the CSF lactic acid levels were significantly higher in the group of proximally located gliomas than in distally located gliomas (p  = 0.028).
PMC3637650	R02007	However, in high-grade gliomas alone, the CSF citric and isocitric acid levels were significantly higher in gliomas with gadolinium enhancement than in those without gadolinium enhancement (citric acid: p  = 0.019, isocitric acid: p  = 0.019).
PMC3637650	R03004	The levels of the following three molecules were significantly increased in gliomas with a mutant IDH compared with that observed in the wild-type IDH gliomas: citric acid (1.43-fold, p  = 0.0114, Q =

PMC3637650	R03011	In addition, in gliomas with a mutant IDH , we observed a trend towards lower succinic, fumaric, and malic acid levels, which are downstream metabolites of isocitric acid in the TCA cycle.

PMC3637650	R04000	During survival analysis using the Kaplan–Meier method for all glioma patients, no significant correlation was discovered between the overall survival (OS) and the CSF level of lactic or citric acid.

PMC3645730	R02001	The result indicated that the concentrations of three metabolites (lysoPC a C16:0, PC ae C42:5 and PC aa C34:2) significantly affected the diagnostic result between breast cancer patients and healthy controls.
PMC3645730	R02002	Using the concentrations of these three metabolites, a diagnostic equation of y = lysoPC a C16:0 × 1.034 + PC ae C42:5 × 44.248 − PC aa C34:2 × 0.585 − 37.002 was established.
PMC3645730	R02009	The result showed no significant difference for these three metabolites (lysoPC a C16:0, PC ae C42:5 and PC
PMC3645730	R03000	Glycerophospholipids contain two subclasses of lipid metabolites, PC diacyl (PC aa) and PC acyl-alkyl (PC ae).
PMC3645730	R03001	A total of 23 glycerophospholipids were selected as differentiating metabolites, most of which were lower in the plasma of breast cancer patients (five of nine PC aas and 11 of 14 PC aes).
PMC3645730	R03002	PC ae 40:3 was detected as the most statistically significant decreased lipid among all the phosphatidylcholines (p -value of 2.79 × 10_−10 ).
PMC3645730	R03003	The decreased glycerophospholipids in the plasma samples of breast cancer patients may reflect a higher activity of phospholipase A2 (PLA_2 ), a family of enzymes, which hydrolyze glycerophospholipids to lysoPCs and fatty acids.
PMC3645730	R03012	It may mediate carcinogenesis by releasing lysoPCs, inducing cell growth via their metabolism to lysophosphatidic acid.
PMC3645730	R03013	Some fatty acids, especially arachidonic acid, are released as well and metabolized into several molecules, many of which may induce cell growth and proliferation.
PMC3645730	R03014	In our study, the concentrations of most lysoPCs were significantly decreased in the plasma samples of breast cancer patients, suggesting arachidonic acid metabolism might be a major contributor to breast cancer development.
PMC3645730	R03016	Recently, PLA_2 inhibitors have become attractive anti-cancer targets for the role of PLA_2 in glycerophospholipid metabolism and carcinogenesis.
PMC3645730	R04000	LysoPCs were derived from partial hydrolysis of glycerophospholipids by phospholipase.
PMC3645730	R04001	In the identified differentiating metabolites between breast cancer patients and healthy controls, 10 of the selected metabolites were lysoPCs.
PMC3645730	R04002	The concentrations of the differentiating lysoPCs were detected to be lower in breast cancer patients compared to healthy controls.
PMC3645730	R04003	LysoPC a C16:0 and lysoPC a C18:0 were identified as the top two differentiating metabolites with the lowest p -values (1.21 × 10_−13 for lysoPC a C16:0 and 4.21 × 10_−13 for lysoPC a C18:0) across all the 39 differentiating metabolites.
PMC3645730	R04004	Interestingly, phosphatidylcholines stearic acid (C18:0) extracted from breast cancer tissue samples was previously reported to be significantly lower in those patients with developed metastasis and was even considered to be an independent intra-tumor marker of breast cancer prognosis.
PMC3645730	R04005	Decreased levels of lysoPC a C16:0 and lysoPC a C18:0 were reported to be associated with a decrease PC level in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues.
PMC3645730	R04006	These two lysoPCs (lysoPC a C 16:0 and lysoPC a C18:0) are among the most abundant lysoPCs in plasma.
PMC3645730	R04007	The decreased levels of two lysoPCs would largely contribute to the lower concentration of total lysoPCs in plasma, which was previously reported to be associated with an activated inflammatory status in cancer patients.
PMC3645730	R04008	In fact, the total plasma lysoPCs (sum of the concentration of all the 14 lysoPCs detected in the current study) was observed to be significantly lower in breast cancer patients (p = 6.87 × 10_−8 , fold change (FC) = −1.67, breast cancer to healthy control).
PMC3645730	R04010	Those lysoPCs include very long chain fatty acids, such as lysoPC a C24:0, lysoPC a C26:0 and lysoPC a C28:0, which were also significantly lower in breast cancer patients.
PMC3645730	R04011	LysoPCs can be metabolized by lysophospholipase and further metabolized to fatty acids and choline.
PMC3645730	R04012	The lower levels of lysoPCs may reflect a higher metabolism rate in breast cancer patients.
PMC3645730	R04013	Hydrolysis of lysoPCs through lysophospholipase D derives lysophosphatidic acids, which are important lipid mediators that regulate cell proliferation and migration by binding G-protein-coupled receptors.
PMC3645730	R04015	In fact, expression of autotaxin and lysophosphatidic acid was reported to contribute to the initiation and progression of breast cancer in a mice model.
PMC3645730	R05000	The higher hydrolysis rate of glycerophospholipids was associated with a higher level of acylcarnitines in the plasma sample of breast cancer patients compared with healthy controls.
PMC3645730	R05001	In this study, acylcarnitine C4 was selected as a differentiating metabolite.
PMC3645730	R05002	In addition, several other acylcarnitines (such as acylcarnitines C18, C18:2, C3 and C5) were detected at a higher concentration in breast cancer patients with p -values lower than 0.05 (p = 0.034 for C18, 0.037 for C18:2 and 0.015 for both C3 and C5).
PMC3645730	R05003	The increased acylcarnitine concentration indicates higher fatty acid beta-oxidation in breast cancer patients, which is consistent with recent studies that indicate that lipolysis and lipid oxidation are upregulated in cancer cells [,].
PMC3645730	R05006	The increased concentration of several acylcarnitines was also observed in kidney cancer patients and in those patients with high cancer grades, suggesting that acylcarnitine concentration could be a promising marker of cancer status and tumor grade.
PMC3645730	R06000	All five differentiating sphingomyelins (SMs), including SM (OH) C22:2, SM (OH) C14:1, SM (OH) C16:1, SM (OH) C22:1 and SM C20:2, were detected at higher levels in breast cancer patients.
PMC3645730	R06003	Some signaling metabolites, such as ceramides, sphingosines and sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), are involved in the cycle.
PMC3645730	R06004	Many studies suggest that ceramide is an important signaling molecule in the cancer cells’ apoptotic response to inducers, such as the FAS/FAS ligand, tumor-necrosis factor-α (TNFα), growth factor withdrawal, hypoxia, hyperthermia and DNA damage.
PMC3645730	R06005	In fact, higher levels of ceramide synthases and ceramide were detected in breast cancer tissues compared with those in adjacent normal ones.
PMC3645730	R06006	S1P is another biologically active lipid derived from SM, which is reported to regulate cancer cell growth, survival and migration through both intracellular and receptor-mediated mechanisms.
PMC3645730	R06007	Recently, Nagahashi and colleagues showed the importance of sphingosine kinase 1-produced S1P to breast cancer-induced hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in a mouse model.
PMC3645730	R06009	Interestingly, all five sphingomyelins containing hydroxyl fatty acids were significantly higher in breast cancer patients (four were selected as differentiating metabolites, the other one was SM (OH) C24:1 with a p -value of 0.014 and an adjusted q -value of 0.050).
PMC3645730	R06010	Although the accurate position of the hydroxyl group in the fatty acids was unclear by this analysis, 2-hydroxy fatty acid has been widely reported in mammalian sphingomyelins (see review).
PMC3645730	R06011	The fatty acid was catalyzed by fatty acid 2-hydroxylase and converted to 2-hydroxy fatty acid (hFA) and then incorporated into hFAceramide and complex hFA-sphingolipids.
PMC3645730	R06013	The higher levels of hFA-sphingolipids indicate a higher expression level of fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, which may affect cancer cell growth in breast cancer patients.
PMC3645730	R06014	The concentrations of some SMs, such as SM (OH) C22:1, SM (OH) C22:2, SM (OH) C24:1 and SM C26:0, were detected to be higher in the early stages of breast cancer and showed a continuous decrease from stage I to stage IV breast cancer patients.
PMC3645730	R06015	SM (OH) C22:1, SM (OH) C24:1 and SM C26:0 were only significantly elevated in those breast cancer patients with early stage cancer (stage I and stage II, with a p -value (Student’s t -test) of 2.13 × 10_−4 , 2.28 × 10_−4 and 0.03, respectively), but not in breast cancer patients at advanced stages (stage III and stage IV, with a p -value higher than 0.05) compared with healthy controls.
PMC3645730	R06018	Bar plots of four characteristic sphingomyelins showed an elevated level in plasma samples in stage I caner as compared to controls and a decreasing trend in the plasma samples from stage I to stage IV breast cancer patients.

PMC3648856	A00001	Limited clinical evidence suggests that this risk could be mediated through changes in estrogen metabolism in premenopausal women.
PMC3648856	A00002	Our objective was to investigate the effects of exercise on premenopausal estrogen metabolism pertinent to breast cancer risk.
PMC3648856	A01001	Urinary levels of estrogens (estrone [E_1 ], estradiol, and estriol) and nine estrogen metabolites were measured at baseline and at study end by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.
PMC3648856	A01002	The ratios of 2-hydroxyestrone to 16α-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE_1 /16α-OHE_1 ) and 2-OHE_1 to 4-hydroxyestrone (2- OHE_1 /4-OHE_1 ) were also calculated.
PMC3648856	A03000	The exercise intervention resulted in a significant increase in the 2-OHE_1 /16α-OHE_1 ratio, but no differences in other estrogen metabolites or ratios.
PMC3648856	A04000	Our results suggest that changes in premenopausal estrogen metabolism may be a mechanism by which increased physical activity lowers breast cancer risk.
PMC3648856	A05000	Aerobic Exercise, Estrogen Metabolism, Randomized Clinical Trial, Breast Cancer Risk
PMC3648856	D00000	We found that in healthy premenopausal women, an exercise regimen of 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise per week for 16 weeks resulted in significant changes in estrogen metabolism in a direction consistent with reduction of breast cancer risk.
PMC3648856	D00001	Specifically, exercise participants experienced a significant increase in urinary levels of 2-OHE_1 and a small non-significant decrease in 16α-OHE_1 levels.
PMC3648856	D00006	Overall, our results differ from those of other exercise intervention studies investigating the effects of aerobic exercise on premenopausal estrogen metabolism.
PMC3648856	D00008	In a small pre-post design study, 4 months of moderate exercise coupled with calorie restriction resulted in non-significantly higher urinary levels of 2-OHE_1 and 16α-OHE_1 and the ratio.
PMC3648856	D00009	In our study, both 2-OHE_1 and the 2-OHE_1 /16α-OHE_1 ratio increased significantly, whereas 16α-OHE_1 decreased non-significantly.
PMC3648856	D00011	When compared to exercise-only interventions, our study remains the only one to report significant changes in estrogen metabolism.
PMC3648856	D00012	For example, in a moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise intervention lasting 12 weeks (30–45 minutes, 4 days per week), Campbell and colleagues reported no significant changes in urinary premenopausal levels of 2-OHE_1 , 16α-OHE_1 , or 2-OHE_1 /16α-OHE_1 ratio.
PMC3648856	D00019	Third, unlike the studies of Campbell et al. and Robles-Gil et al., in which first morning urine samples were used, WISER participants collected three 24-hour urine collections allowing for a more robust and representative analysis of the chronic effect of aerobic exercise on estrogen metabolism.
PMC3648856	D00020	Finally, our study provides the most comprehensive analysis on the effects of exercise on estrogen metabolism to date.
PMC3648856	D00021	We have analyzed urinary levels of the major parent estrogens (E_1 , E_2 and E_3 ) and nine of their estrogen metabolites by LC/MS-MS.
PMC3648856	D00024	Altogether, the findings of the WISER study are significant because they provide the first clinical evidence that aerobic exercise can significantly change estrogen metabolism in premenopausal women.
PMC3648856	D00025	Specifically, our results show that such an exercise intervention can lead to increases in 2-OHE_1 and possible decreases in 16α-OHE_1 ultimately resulting in significant increases in the 2-OHE_1 /16α-OHE_1 ratio.
PMC3648856	D00028	Perhaps one mechanism by which exercise mediates estrogen metabolism is through the regulation of P-450 cytochrome enzymes responsible for controlling estrogen hydroxylation and catecholestrogen methylation.
PMC3648856	D00029	Given the implication these results have for breast cancer prevention efforts, future studies should not only attempt to corroborate our results, but also investigate the exact mechanisms by which exercise leads to these favorable estrogen metabolism changes.
PMC3648856	M05003	At the end of each collection day, urine was transferred into a 3-liter bottle containing ascorbic acid (1 mg/mL) to prevent oxidation, and stored in a home refrigerator or cooler provided by the study.
PMC3648856	M06000	Urinary estrogens (E_1 , E_2 , and E_3 ) and their metabolites (2-OHE_1 , 2-OHE_2 , 16α-OHE_1 , 4-OHE_1 , 4-OHE_2 , 2-MeOE_1 , 2-MeOE_2 , 4-MeOE_1 , and 4-MeOE_2 ) were analyzed in the mid-follicular phase of baseline and follow-up cycles by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry
PMC3648856	M06004	Concentrations were expressed both as nanomol per day (nmol/day) and nanograms per milligram of creatinine (ng/mg Cr).
PMC3648856	M06005	Urinary creatinine was analyzed at the Fairview University Diagnostic Laboratories.
PMC3648856	M06008	The mean intra-assay and inter-assay CVs were 5.1% and 13.4% for E_1 ; 5.2% and 16.0% for E_2 ; 5.6% and 11.4% for E_3 ; 4.2% and 12.3% for 2-OHE_1 ; 7.7% and 10.8% for 2-OHE_2 ; 6.2% and 18.7% for 16α-OHE_1 ; 4.3% and 12.2% for 4-OHE_1 ; 14.0% and 51.2% for 4-OHE_2 ; 7.0% and 11.3% for 2-MeOE_1 ; 5.8% and 10.0% for 2-MeOE_2 ; 7.4% and 10.3% for 4-MeOE_1 ; and 6.9% and 7.9% for 4-MeOE_2 .
PMC3648856	M07001	Two estrogen metabolite ratios of interest, namely the 2-OHE_1 /16α-OHE_1 ratio and 2-OHE_1 /4-OHE_1 ratio, were calculated by dividing the concentration of 2-OHE_1 by either 16α-OHE_1 or 4-OHE_1 , respectively.
PMC3648856	M07010	Estrogen metabolite data were analyzed as both nmol/day and ng/mg
PMC3648856	R01000	With the exception of 2-OHE_1 (P = 0.084) and 2-OHE_1 /16α-OHE_1 ratio (P = 0.044), exercisers had similar levels of urinary estrogens, estrogen metabolites, and 2-OHE_1 /4-OHE_1 ratio than control participants at baseline.
PMC3648856	R01002	Effects of 16 Weeks of Aerobic Exercise on Estrogen Metabolism of WISER participants NOTE:
PMC3648856	R01005	Within-group differences: Overall, the concentration of estrone and its metabolites were higher than their estradiol counterparts, especially for E_1 , 2-OHE_1 , 4-OHE_1 , and 4-MeOE_1 as compared to E_2 , 2-OHE_2 , 4-OHE_2 , and 4-MeOE_2 , respectively.
PMC3648856	R01006	Estrogen hydroxylation showed an isomeric preference for the C-2 position.
PMC3648856	R01007	Specifically, concentrations of 2-OHE_1 were about 14- and 20-fold higher than those of 16α-OHE_1 and 4-OHE_1 , respectively, and concentration of 2-OHE_2 about 40-fold those of 4-OHE_2 .
PMC3648856	R03005	As previously reported, the exercise intervention resulted in no significant changes in endogenous levels of E_2 , estrone sulfate, progesterone, T, or SHBG.
PMC3648856	R03010	No significant within-group changes or between-group differences at follow-up were observed for other estrogens, estrogen metabolites, or ratios.
PMC3648856	R03011	Changes in Baseline vs. Baseline in 2-OHE1/16α-OHE1 Ratio
PMC3660334	A03001	After adjusting for maternal age, parity, body mass index and smoking habits, the most statistically significant changes were observed for glycine, threonine, lactate and glycerophosphocholine (upward trend), and for citrate (downward trend).
PMC3660334	D00003	Glycine, threonine, lactate and GPC were significantly increased while citrate was decreased.
PMC3660334	D00004	These metabolites are involved in amino-acids metabolism, oxidation/reduction pathways and mitochondrial metabolism (citrate cycle) as shown in .
PMC3660334	D00005	Glycine is a cytoprotective agent because it scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibits inflammatory response.
PMC3660334	D00007	According to previous data showing ROS generation after exposure to organophosphorous or pyrethroids , , we hypothesize that the increase in urinary glycine could result from a protective mechanism against the oxidative stress induced by a more complex exposure to pesticides.
PMC3660334	D00008	This oxidative stress may induce a mitochondrial dysfunction with an impairment of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle resulting in a decrease in citrate levels.
PMC3660334	D00009	The observed increase in urinary lactate supports the hypothesis of an alteration of the energy metabolism .
PMC3660334	D00010	GPC plays an important role in the structural integrity of cell membranes .
PMC3660334	D00012	Threonine plays an important role in the TCA cycle.
PMC3660334	D00013	Its catabolism in mammals forms 2-oxobutyrate, glycine and acetylCoA .
PMC3660334	D00014	Its increase could be linked with a disruption in the TCA cycle.
PMC3660334	D00015	But amino-acids such as threonine join the fetal blood through active transport systems in the placenta .
PMC3660334	D00016	An increase in urinary threonine could also be due to an enhancement in plasmatic threonine induced by a disruption of fetoplacental transfers as has been observed in mothers delivering very low birth weight infants .
PMC3660334	D00022	Gunier et al. showed a correlation between concentrations of chlorpyrifos, chlorthal-dimethyl, iprodione, phosmet and simazine in house dust (89 dwellings) and the proximity of agricultural activities (within 1,250 m).
PMC3660334	D00024	Bradman et al. studied the determinants of organophosphorous exposure in 400 Californian children and showed that among the 12-month-old infants, the concentrations of dialkylphosphate metabolites (coming from organophosphorus) in urine were higher when children lived within 60 m of an agricultural field .

PMC3660334	R00010	The second one has no specific characteristics compared to the other individuals but a high concentration of hippurate was detected in her urinary sample.
PMC3660334	R00011	A specific dietary habit (benzoate-rich diet for example) may have contributed to this high level of hippurate.
PMC3660334	R00024	The most statistically significant changes with OSC data were observed for glycine, lactate, threonine and glycerophosphocholine (GPC) (on the left of the loading plot) with an upward trend, and citrate and hippurate (on the right of the loading plot), with a downward trend.
PMC3660334	R00026	Trends in crude associations as estimated by polytomous regressions using spectral data before filtering by OSC were similar to what was observed in except for hippurate.
PMC3660334	R00027	Adjustment for smoking status, BMI, age and parity, provided trends similar or slightly increased: upward trends for glycine, threonine, lactate and GPC, a downward trend for citrate, and no association for hippurate.
PMC3660334	R00028	As an example, compared to exposure group 0 (cereal ≤17%), a unit increase in lactate level multiplies the odds of belonging to exposure group 1 (cereal >17%–25%) and group 2 (cereal >25%) by 1.36 and 1.47 respectively.

PMC3661207	D00028	Fatty acid oxidation decreased during therapy as evidenced by decreases in markers of lipid β-oxidation (acetyl-carnitines and ketone bodies) and decreases in the byproducts of ω–oxidation, a secondary pathway to fatty acid metabolism.
PMC3661207	D00036	2-HB fell significantly during the first three months of hormonal therapy and BCKDH complex products were stable to lower at three months.
PMC3661207	D00037	Rise in 2-HB was identified as a biomarker of insulin resistance in the Relationship of Insulin Sensitivity to Cardiovascular Risk (RISK) study.
PMC3661207	D00038	In that cohort of 399 non-diabetic subjects, plasma metabolomic analyses revealed 2-HB to be the biomarker best able to discriminate between insulin sensitive and insulin resistant men (as defined by gold-standard hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp testing).

PMC3661207	D00057	Fourth, changes in some biochemicals have been shown to emerge far sooner than 3 months after a drop in testosterone levels (e.g. insulin_, ).
PMC3661207	D00062	For example, this analysis detected a statistically significant 1.9 fold rise in the primary bile acid cholate but is not able to accurately specify plasma levels of cholate for the two experimental time points.

PMC3661207	R02002	The rise in cholate was statistically significant.
PMC3661207	R02003	Glycocholenate sulfate and taurocholenate sulfate each fell slightly.

PMC3661207	R03002	Several acyl carnitines were significantly lower following ADT, including deoxycarnitine, acetylcarnitine, hexanoylcarnitine, octanoylcarnitine, decanoylcarnitine, laurylcarnitine, palmitoylcarnitine, stearoylcarnitine and oleoylcarnitine (p<0.05 for each compound).

PMC3661207	R04001	2-hydroxybutyrate (2-HB, or AHB) and branch chain keto-acid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex products have previously been associated with IR.
PMC3661207	R04002	2-HB is an organic acid and can be a byproduct of 2-ketobutyrate (α-KB) production.
PMC3661207	R04003	α-KB itself can be produced by amino acid catabolism.
PMC3661207	R04004	2-HB generally rises during states of disrupted metabolism (e.g. lactic acidosis, ketoacidosis) or in the presence of an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio.
PMC3661207	R04005	Treatment levels of 2-HB were significantly lower than baseline levels (0.84 fold change, p=0.03).
PMC3661207	R04007	Many components of branched chain amino acid metabolism did not change significantly, while two were significantly lower on treatment than at baseline (α-hydroxyisovalerate, 2-methylbutyroylcarnitine; p<0.05 for each).
PMC3663699	A02001	Analysis of lipids that were driving group separation in the OPLS-DA model and that were significantly elevated in the obese group led to identification of a group of ether-linked phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipids of interest.
PMC3663699	A02002	Treatment of human coronary artery endothelial cells with the ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine induced expression of cell adhesion molecules, a hallmark of endothelial cell activation.

PMC3663699	D00003	The major findings of this study were that a group of ether-linked lipids was elevated in plasma from morbidly obese subjects compared to control, and PE-(P-18:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) increased cell adhesion molecule protein but not the inflammatory mediator MCP-1 in endothelial cells.
PMC3663699	D00004	In addition, PAPC, PGPC, POVPC, and PEIPC were not elevated in our obese group compared to control.
PMC3663699	D01001	Following our conservative and strict approach to narrowing down the total lipid profile to a small list of lipids of interest, a group of ether-linked phospholipids that were elevated in obese subject plasma compared to control that were driving the separation of groups in our model emerged.
PMC3663699	D01003	Standard ether-linked lipids as well as plasmalogens both appeared on our list, and the ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine used in our in vitro experiments was a plasmalogen.
PMC3663699	D01008	Graesssler et al. found a significant increase in multiple PE plasmalogens in individuals with BMI > 27.5, but diminished ether-linked lipids in individuals with increasing HOMA-IR.
PMC3663699	D01009	A comparison of obese and non-obese twins found that more ether-linked phospholipids were diminished in the obese twin compared to the lean than were elevated.
PMC3663699	D01010	Other recent work profiling lipid composition of LDL found that plasmalogen PEs are decreased in metabolic syndrome patients compared to lean, as well as in diabetics compared to lean, and the proportion of plasmalogen PE negatively correlates with waist circumference.
PMC3663699	D01011	Conversely, it has also been reported that plasmalogen presence is greater in hypercholesterolemic subjects, and that the ratio of plasmalogen PE to ester PE was increased in a population of diabetic patients without cardiovascular complications compared to controls.
PMC3663699	D01013	Collectively, the work of others as well as the current investigation support further examination of why ether-linked phospholipids vary between lean control and obese subjects and what the role of ether-linked lipids in metabolic disease may be.
PMC3663699	D02000	Ether-linked phospholipids are present in most cell membranes and studies of their function have ranged from signalling in brain cells to antioxidant properties [-].
PMC3663699	D02003	Ether-linked plasmalogens in particular are preferentially oxidized over ester-linked phospholipids, possibly due to structural differences leaving the polyunsaturated sn-2 side chains more exposed, and lower bond dissociation energies of ether linkages.
PMC3663699	D02008	Ether-linked lipids may be pro-inflammatory and can serve as arachidonic acid reservoirs.
PMC3663699	D02009	Ether-linked lipids, particularly plasmalogens have a high proportion of arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position, and are involved in membrane remodeling as well as intracellular arachidonic acid metabolism [,].
PMC3663699	D02010	Arachidonic acid released from the sn-2 position of ether and ester lipids can be enzymatically oxidized to form prostaglandins, prostacyclin, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes, all of which are pro-inflammatory [,].
PMC3663699	D02011	Ether-linked lipids and oxidation products of ether-linked lipids include proinflammatory lysophospholipids that are platelet activating factor (PAF) precursors, and lysophospholipids independently can be pro-inflammatory and pathological.
PMC3663699	D02012	Lysophosphocholines (LPCs) have been shown to increase plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a potent prothrombotic and proatherogenic protein.
PMC3663699	D02013	In addition, LPCs can induce endothelial cell expression of cell adhesion molecules, an important step in endothelial cell activation and atherosclerotic progression [,].
PMC3663699	D02014	Ether-linked lipids with arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position serve as PAF synthesis precursors.
PMC3663699	D02015	PAF is an ether-linked species with a choline head group, an ether-linked fatty acid at the sn-1 position and an acetyl group at the sn-2 position that is a potent stimulator of the platelet coagulation cascade, thrombosis, and inflammation.
PMC3663699	D02018	The ether-linked phospholipids, including those identified in our analysis with arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position and choline head groups, may serve as substrate for PAF formation and thus be characterized as pro-inflammatory.
PMC3663699	D03000	To address whether ether-linked lipids can induce phenotypic changes in endothelial cells, we performed in vitro experiments using a commercially available ether-linked PE, PE-(P-18:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)), that corresponded to a species we identified as elevated in obese subjects.
PMC3663699	D03001	This PE stimulated cell adhesion molecule expression in human coronary artery endothelial cells a key step in atherogenesis.
PMC3663699	D03002	The increases we observed in cell adhesion molecule expression were similar in magnitude to those observed in endothelial cells following oxidized PAPC treatment.
PMC3663699	D03003	We cannot conclude based on these data that the effects of this plasmalogen phosphatidylethanolamine are representative of other ether-linked lipids, including those ether-linked phosphatidylcholines that were also identified during our analysis.
PMC3663699	D04000	The finding that phosphatidylcholine oxidation products that have been shown in vitro to induce disease related phenotypic changes in endothelial cells were not elevated in our obese subjects was unexpected.
PMC3663699	D04001	Because oxidized phosphatidylcholine products have been found in modified LDL and atherosclerotic lesions from high fat fed rabbits and oxidized LDL has been found in lesions isolated from human vessels, we hypothesized they would be elevated in morbidly obese subjects compared to control.
PMC3663699	D04002	Our findings do not discredit the data indicating detrimental effects of oxidized PAPC on endothelial cells, however oxidized PAPC products did not drive the separation between control and obese groups in our model.
PMC3663699	D04003	Our data support the importance of examining other classes of lipids and presence of oxidized phospholipids in human plasma and LDL.
PMC3663699	D05004	Further, these findings translated to examination of the pathophysiological roles for this class of lipids, where PE-(P-18:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) induces cell adhesion molecule expression in coronary artery endothelial cells.
PMC3663699	M03000	Lipid extractions were performed using the methyl-tert butyl ether (MTBE) method described by Matyash et al., with all steps performed in the Captair Pyramid glove box (Erlab, Rowley, MA) under argon gas to prevent exposure to oxygen and subsequent oxidation of lipids.
PMC3663699	M03001	Briefly, 200 μL plasma was added to 80 μL of MS grade H_2 O in a glass tube with a Teflon lined cap, followed by addition of 1.5 mL of molecular grade methanol.
PMC3663699	M03002	The tubes were vortexed, 5 ml of molecular grade MTBE was added, and then the samples were rocked for 1 hr at room temperature.
PMC3663699	M03005	Samples were re-suspended in 1 mL of LC-MS grade methanol and topped with high purity argon gas.
PMC3663699	M04001	Solvent A consisted of an 89:5:5:1 mixture of water, isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile and 500 mM ammonium acetate respectively.
PMC3663699	M04002	Solvent B consisted of a 50:49:1 mixture of isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile, and 500 mM ammonium acetate, respectively.
PMC3663699	M07001	Standards were commercially available (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) for three of the tentatively identified lipids of interest, 1-0-1’-(Z)-Octadecenyl-2-Arachidonoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphoethanolamine, 1-Palmitoyl-2-Linoleoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphocholine, and 1-octadecanoyl-2-(5Z, 8Z, 11Z, 14Z-eicosatetraenoyl)-sn-Glycero-3-Phospho-(1’-myo-inositol))and we performed MS/MS on those available to confirm our tentative identifications.
PMC3663699	M07002	Following confirmation of our tentative identifications, we used the ether-linked phosphoethanolamine standard in cell culture treatments to determine if it induced pathological phenotypic changes in endothelial cells.
PMC3663699	M08002	Lipid treatments included normal medium, vehicle controls, and the 1-0-1’-(Z)-Octadecenyl-2-Arachidonoyl-sn-Glycero-3-Phosphoethanolamine (PE) standard.
PMC3663699	M08003	This PE standard was used for endothelial cell treatments as a representative ether-linked lipid because it was the ether-linked standard on our list that was commercially available.
PMC3663699	M08004	Treatment concentration for the PE standard was 25 μg/mL, with all treatments performed for 4 hrs and repeated a minimum of three times in duplicate or triplicate.
PMC3663699	M08005	HCAEC were also treated with L-α-Phosphatidylcholine (PC) standard (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), and PC standard that was oxidized by exposure to room air for 48 hrs as previously described, to confirm the effects of previously described oxidized PAPC in our model.

PMC3663699	R02003	We discovered that multiple ether-linked phospholipids were significantly higher in the obese group compared to control and were driving group separation in the OPLS-DA model.
PMC3663699	R02008	Figure  shows a representative MS/MS spectra of PE(P-18:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) an ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), in one of our samples, that was identified in negative mode, and a previously published spectra of the same ion confirming our tentative identification of that ion.

PMC3663699	R03000	To determine the effect of our identified ether linked lipids on endothelial cells, we used PE-(P-18:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z))
PMC3663699	R03006	Because previous studies have described induction of ICAM and VCAM by oxidized phospholipids, we also used oxidized phosphatidylcholine (ox-PC) to treat HCAEC.
PMC3663699	R03007	Ox-PC also induced increases in ICAM (180% of control, p = 0.038) and VCAM (169% of control, p = 0.051), while there was no effect of un-oxidized PC.
PMC3663699	R04000	Because previous in vitro data indicate that ox-PC products cause pathological phenotypic changes in endothelial cells, we targeted PC and ox-PC in our LC/MS data from morbidly obese and control plasma using a targeted approach.
PMC3663699	R04001	We scanned all ions in the positive mode analysis for any that could be PC, PGPC, POVPC, or PEIPC based on m/z and abundance.
PMC3663699	R04002	While none of the best potential matches for these lipids were between 0.5 and 1 in our OPLS-DA models, one potential PC match appeared to be significantly higher in obese subjects compared to control (p = 0.040), though the other potential match had a much higher relative abundance (as would be expected for PC because it is the most abundant phospholipid in cells) and was not significantly different.
PMC3663699	R04003	Of the best matches for the ox-PC species, only those for PGPC were close to significantly elevated in the obese compared to control (p = 0.052, and 0.055), while the best potential matches for PEIPC were not significant (p = 0.707, and 0.661) and no ions that could represent POVPC were detected (Table ).
PMC3663699	R04004	Oxidized PAPC products from positive mode analysis p-values were calculated using an unpaired t -test comparison of group means for each ion.
PMC3682342	A00000	Cancer-associated isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutations produce the metabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), but the clinical utility of 2HG has not been established.
PMC3682342	A00001	We studied whether 2HG measurements in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients correlate with IDH mutations, and whether diagnostic or remission 2HG measurements predict survival.
PMC3682342	A00002	Sera from 223 de novo AML patients were analyzed for 2HG concentration by reverse-phase liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry.
PMC3682342	A00003	Pretreatment 2HG levels ranged from 10 to 30 000 ng/mL and were elevated in IDH-mutants (median, 3004 ng/mL), compared to wild-type IDH (median, 61 ng/mL)
PMC3682342	A00005	2HG levels did not differ among IDH1 or IDH2 allelic variants.
PMC3682342	A00006	In receiver operating characteristic analysis, a discriminatory level of 700 ng/mL optimally segregated patients with and without IDH mutations, and on subsequent mutational analysis of the 13 IDH wild-type samples with 2HG levels >700 ng/mL, 9 were identified to have IDH mutations.
PMC3682342	A00007	IDH-mutant patients with 2HG levels >200 at complete remission had shorter overall survival compared to 2HG ≤200 ng/mL (hazard ratio, 3.9; P = .02).
PMC3682342	A00008	We establish a firm association between IDH mutations and serum 2HG concentration in AML, and confirm that serum oncometabolite measurements provide useful diagnostic and prognostic information that can improve patient selection for IDH-targeted therapies.
PMC3682342	D00000	Discovery of neomorphic 2HG production as a consequence of recurrent IDH mutations in AML and in other malignancies has strengthened the proposed link between abnormal cellular metabolism, epigenetic reprogramming, and oncogenic transformation.
PMC3682342	D00001	Elevated serum 2HG levels in patients with IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have been described previously in several small AML cohorts; however, the relationship between serum 2HG levels, IDH mutations, and patient outcome has not been defined previously.
PMC3682342	D00002	Our study is the first to fully assess pretreatment serum 2HG levels in a cohort of patients with AML treated on a uniform protocol, and to investigate the usefulness of 2HG as a prognostic biomarker.
PMC3682342	D00003	Our analysis confirms a clear relationship between the presence of an IDH mutation (IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172, or IDH2 R140) and an elevated serum 2HG level, with 97% of patients with IDH mutations having a detectable 2HG level at the time of AML diagnosis, and a median 2HG concentration nearly 50-fold higher than that of patients with IDH wild-type mutations.
PMC3682342	D00004	An association between diagnostic WBC count and serum 2HG levels was identified in patients with IDH mutations, suggesting that circulating WBC count as a measure of “tumor burden” may relate to the level of serum 2HG in these patients.
PMC3682342	D00005	We also found low but detectable levels of serum 2HG in the majority of patients with wild-type IDH AML, as well as in normal volunteers.
PMC3682342	D00007	We found that pretreatment serum 2HG levels >700 ng/mL best predict IDH mutational status.
PMC3682342	D00008	Notably, subsequent mutation testing in 13 patients initially characterized as having IDH wild-type mutations and with diagnostic 2HG levels >700 ng/mL reclassified 9 patients as having IDH mutations, albeit at low allelic burden.
PMC3682342	D00010	Given that AML is a heterogeneous disease involving distinctive subclones even within the same patient, the ability to detect small IDH-mutant clones undetectable by current molecular techniques, yet leading to 2HG accumulation, must be considered.
PMC3682342	D00012	Additional sequencing and analysis of the 4 samples with 2HG levels >700 ng/mL and without identified IDH mutations are ongoing.
PMC3682342	D00013	It is possible that mutations in the noncoding regions of IDH1 or IDH2 , or alterations in other enzymes involved in αKG metabolism, occur in patients without canonic IDH1 or IDH2 mutations.
PMC3682342	D00014	Our data suggest that diagnostic serum 2HG measurements may allow for rapid, accurate identification of patients with AML with IDH mutations.
PMC3682342	D00015	2HG testing in patients with glioma, cholangiocarcinoma, and chondrosarcoma may provide similarly useful diagnostic and/or prognostic information.
PMC3682342	D00017	As improved sequencing techniques increase the sensitivity of genetic tests, future studies will be required to compare the sensitivity of 2HG analysis to next-generation testing methodologies.
PMC3682342	D00018	Drugs targeting mutant IDH are currently being tested in the preclinical setting with promising results,_, thus increasing the significance of serum 2HG levels in the selection of patients for such treatment.
PMC3682342	D00019	Serial 2HG measurements may emerge as an important pharmacodynamics marker of IDH-modulating agents and other antileukemic therapies.
PMC3682342	D00021	Our analysis suggests that the level of serum 2HG alone does not explain the improved survival duration seen in the IDH2 R140 cohort compared with patients with other IDH1 or IDH2 mutations.
PMC3682342	D00023	It is important to consider that serum 2HG level is only a surrogate measurement for intracellular levels of 2HG in malignant cells, and the true biologic interpretation of serum
PMC3682342	D00024	2HG levels is not clear at this time.
PMC3682342	D00025	The relationship between intracellular and extracellular 2HG levels, the half-life of serum 2HG, and mechanisms of normal 2HG breakdown and elimination will require further clarification.
PMC3682342	D00026	In patients with IDH mutations, a decrease of serum 2HG levels to <200 ng/mL at CR was predictive of improved OS (P = .02).
PMC3682342	D00027	This finding suggests that 2HG testing may represent a sensitive means to assess residual leukemic cells after induction chemotherapy, and serve as a marker of MRD with which to guide subsequent therapeutic decisions.
PMC3682342	D00028	Prospective studies are needed to confirm this observation and to inform the use of 2HG measurement as a quantitative tool, compared with other markers of MRD such as flow cytometry and genetic analysis.
PMC3682342	D00029	Taken together, our data provide a rationale for serum 2HG measurement as a diagnostic, prognostic, and monitoring tool in AML and may establish a role for oncometabolite testing in the clinical setting to improve on therapeutic decisions.
PMC3682342	M00000	Pretreatment peripheral blood (PB) sera from 223 E1900 patients were analyzed for 2HG levels, in addition to 14 PB serum samples from healthy adult volunteers (>18 years old).
PMC3682342	M01000	Serum 2HG levels were measured by reverse-phase liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) by Agios Pharmaceuticals (Cambridge, MA).
PMC3682342	M01002	A 2HG level <10 ng/mL was defined as below the level of detection using the LC-MS assay (ie, below the quantitation limit) and was analyzed as 10 ng/mL. Similarly, 2HG levels >30 000 ng/mL were considered above the quantitation limit and were analyzed as 30 000 ng/mL, as values above this level were extrapolated.
PMC3682342	M01003	2HG analysis was repeated for 21 selected samples and demonstrated reproducible 2HG levels with a mean intrasample coefficient of variation of 24.8%.
PMC3682342	M01004	The intrasample variation was most pronounced in samples with markedly elevated 2HG levels and did not affect the interpretation of the IDH mutational status.
PMC3682342	M02000	Nonparametric analyses were performed because of the non-Gaussian distribution of 2HG levels.
PMC3682342	M02002	2HG level was evaluated as both a continuous and a categorical variable.
PMC3682342	M02003	Discriminatory cutoff values for 2HG were evaluated to maximize sensitivity, specificity, and create an optimal cutoff point for clinical purposes through receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.
PMC3682342	M02008	Because of the presence of 2HG values above or below the limits of accurate LC-MS detection, a censored regression model (Tobit) was used, which estimates linear relationships between variables when there is either left- or right-censoring of the dependent variable.
PMC3682342	R00004	The presence of an IDH mutation correlated with DNMT3A mutations (P = .022) and correlated inversely with FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3 ) mutations (P < .0005) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (CEPBA ) mutations (P = .023).

PMC3682342	R01000	Pretreatment serum 2HG levels ranged from 10 ng/mL to 30 000 ng/mL, with a median value of 101 ng/mL for all patients tested.
PMC3682342	R01001	In patients with IDH wild-type AML, levels of 2HG ranged from 10 ng/mL to 14 181 ng/mL
PMC3682342	R01003	Serum 2HG levels in patients with IDH mutations ranged from 10 ng/mL to 30 000 ng/mL (median, 3004 ng/mL).
PMC3682342	R01004	2HG could be detected in 159 (71%) of all samples, including 60 (96.8%) of 62 samples from patients with IDH mutations, and 99 (61.5%) of 161 samples from patients with wild-type IDH.
PMC3682342	R01005	2HG levels were significantly higher in patients with IDH mutations, compared with patients with IDH wild-type AML (P < .0005).
PMC3682342	R01006	Serum 2HG levels in volunteers were also obtained (see “Serum 2HG levels in healthy volunteers”) and ranged from 33 ng/mL to 176 ng/mL (median, 48 ng/mL).

PMC3682342	R01009	On univariate Tobit regression analysis, an elevated serum 2HG level at diagnosis was associated with an elevated platelet count (P < .0005) and an elevated BM blast percentage at diagnosis (P = .027).
PMC3682342	R01010	We observed an association between an elevated WBC count and serum 2HG level of borderline significance (P = .057); when analyzing only IDH mutations, we identified a strong association between WBC count and elevated level of serum 2HG (P = .007).
PMC3682342	R01011	No statistically significant association was observed between 2HG level and patient age and sex, treating institution, or study group treatment.
PMC3682342	R01012	In patients with IDH mutations, serum 2HG level relates to WBC count at AML diagnosis.
PMC3682342	R01013	Next, we evaluated serum 2HG levels in patients with IDH mutations, based on the specific IDH1 or IDH2 mutation present.
PMC3682342	R01014	No significant difference in 2HG levels among patients with IDH mutations was identified based on the specific allelic mutation.
PMC3682342	R01015	Of note, 2HG levels in IDH2 R140 mutations did not differ significantly from the other IDH mutations at baseline or after adjustment for WBC count, BM, or circulating blast percentage.
PMC3682342	R01016	Distribution of 2HG levels based on IDH allelic variant.
PMC3682342	R02000	Next, we asked whether a “threshold” level of serum 2HG level could serve as a useful screening test to segregate patients with AML with or without IDH mutations.
PMC3682342	R02001	Using ROC analysis, we identified a strong correlation between serum 2HG level and IDH mutations, with an area under the ROC curve between wild-type IDH and IDH mutations of 0.918, and an optimal cutoff point of 700 ng/mL. When applying this discriminatory 700-ng/mL value, we found that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of serum 2HG level for predicting IDH mutations was 86.9% and 90.7%, respectively, with 89.6% of patients correctly classified.
PMC3682342	R02002	ROC curve of IDH mutational status and 2HG level.
PMC3682342	R02003	There were 15 IDH wild-type E1900 samples with pretreatment 2HG levels measuring >700 ng/mL. Of those, 13 samples were reanalyzed for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations using identical mutation detection methodology, at the same institution as the initial mutation analysis, with manual inspection of all traces.
PMC3682342	R03000	To further investigate the potential of serum 2HG measurements as a diagnostic test, we studied 2HG levels in the serum of 14 healthy volunteers.
PMC3682342	R03001	In these volunteers, the median 2HG level was 48 ng/mL (range, 33-176 ng/mL).
PMC3682342	R03002	No association was observed between 2HG level with patient age or sex.
PMC3682342	R03003	Of note, no significant difference was found between median 2HG level in volunteers (48 ng/mL) with the median value of IDH wild-type AML samples (61 ng/mL; or 50 ng/mL if the 9 samples with identified IDH mutations were excluded).
PMC3682342	R03004	All 14 healthy volunteers had detectable serum 2HG levels by LC-MS.
PMC3682342	R04000	Sera from 29 of the E1900 patients with IDH mutations at the time of CR (see supplemental Text for additional clinicopathologic characteristics of the remission cohort) revealed a median 2HG level of 95 ng/mL (range, 28-3149 ng/mL), compared with a median 2HG of 3234 ng/mL (range, 10-13 638 ng/mL) in these 29 patients at AML diagnosis.
PMC3682342	R04001	The median change in 2HG level from diagnosis to remission was 3088 ng/mL (range, +43 to −13 363 ng/mL).
PMC3682342	R04002	2HG levels decreased in all but 1 patient (this patient had a diagnosis 2HG level below the quantitation limit and 53 ng/mL at CR).
PMC3682342	R04003	Neither the absolute difference in 2HG level nor the percent change in 2HG levels, from diagnosis to CR, was associated with survival duration.
PMC3682342	R04004	Next, we assessed whether achieving a “normal level” of serum 2HG at CR provided prognostic value.
PMC3682342	R04005	Given that 2HG levels of healthy volunteers ranged from 33 ng/mL to 176 ng/mL, we defined a normal 2HG level as <200 ng/mL. Of the 29 IDH-mutant remission samples, 20 (69%) achieved a remission 2HG level <200 ng/mL. Patients who did not achieve a 2HG level <200 ng/mL at CR experienced inferior OS (hazard ratio [HR], 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.2-12.7; P = .02) and LFS (HR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.1-11.9; P = .046), which retained significance on multivariable analysis (supplemental Table 2).
PMC3682342	R04006	Median OS was 23.5 months in the group with 2HG levels >200 ng/mL and was not reached in the group with 2HG levels <200 ng/mL.
PMC3682342	R04007	Because mutational analysis for IDH at the time of CR was not performed, we cannot compare the sensitivity of serum 2HG with molecular tests for minimal residual disease (MRD).
PMC3682342	R04008	(A) 2HG levels at diagnosis and at CR in 29 IDH-mutant samples (dotted line at 200 ng/mL); (B) Kaplan-Meier survival curve of OS based on remission 2HG.
PMC3682342	R05001	2HG level on attainment of CR (P = .24).
PMC3682342	R05002	There was a suggestion of improved survival outcome in patients with an elevated pretreatment 2HG level, although this finding was not statistically significant for OS (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.49-1.06; P = .09) or LFS (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.41-1.06; P = .08).
PMC3682342	R05003	Interactions were identified between an elevated level of serum 2HG (>700 ng/mL) and mutational status of co-occurring mutations including NPM1 and CEPBA .
PMC3682342	R05004	This trend implies that other genetic abnormalities may alter the magnitude of the relationship between 2HG level and clinical outcome, and is consistent with recent data suggesting that NPM1/IDH double mutations have a favorable outcome.
PMC3682342	R05005	When evaluating pretreatment 2HG levels using our threshold of 700 ng/mL on multivariable analysis (including allocated treatment group), we observed that an elevated 2HG level was associated with improved OS in patients with NPM1 mutations (n = 106) (HR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.22-0.77; P = .004), and in those without DNMT3A mutations (n = 144) (HR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26-0.84; P = .01) or CEPBA mutations (n = 198) (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.43-0.94; P = .02) (supplemental Tables 3-5 and supplemental Figures 2-6).
PMC3682342	R05006	Finally, the level of serum 2HG was analyzed separately within the 3 IDH allelic mutant cohorts and was split by the median 2HG level observed in IDH mutations (3004 ng/mL).
PMC3682342	R05007	Despite the small cohort size, there was a suggestion of decreased OS in patients with a more elevated 2HG level and IDH2 R172 mutations (HR, 7.29; 95% CI, 0.79-67.1; P = .08).
PMC3682342	R05008	The OS in patients with IDH1 R132 or IDH2 R140 mutations did not appear to be affected by the level of serum 2HG elevation at diagnosis (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.34-2.96; P = .98 and HR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.59-5.57; P = .28, respectively).
PMC3708771	A01001	The deproteinization step was optimized with 20% methanol/ethanol at a plasma:solvent ratio of 1:3.
PMC3708771	A01003	With respect to the step of reconstitution, 0.1% formic acid was designated as the reconstitution solvent vs. 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate, based on the comparable number of metabolite peaks detected in both solvents, and yet the signal detected in the former was higher.
PMC3708771	M00000	Methanol, ethanol, chloroform, and water were purchased from J.T. Baker (New Jersey, USA).
PMC3708771	M00001	Formic acid and ammonium bicarbonate were from Sigma (St. Louis, USA).
PMC3708771	M01005	In brief, in the step of monophasic deproteinization, various combinations of methanol/ethanol (100%/0%; 80%/20%; 50%/50%; 20%/80%; and 0%/100%) were added to 100 μL of plasma at a ratio of either 1:3 or 1:9 (plasma:solvent).
PMC3708771	M01008	In the step of biphasic deproteinization, 200 μL of plasma was mixed with 100 μL of chloroform and 200 μL of methanol or ethanol.
PMC3708771	M01010	200 μL of water and 200 μL of chloroform were then added.
PMC3708771	M01012	The lyophilized pellets as result were either reconstituted in equal initial plasma volume of 0.1% formic acid/H_2 O or 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate/H_2 O prior to mass spectrometric analysis.
PMC3708771	R01004	In monophasic extraction, ethanol or methanol was added at a ratio of 1:3 or 1:9 (plasma:solvent), respectively.
PMC3708771	R01005	In biphasic extraction, chloroform with either methanol or ethanol was added; followed by 50% chloroform.
PMC3708771	R01009	As illustrated in Table , extraction of plasma samples by either 100% of methanol or 100% of ethanol generated comparable panel of metabolites.
PMC3708771	R01010	To systematically refine the monophasic deproteinization that best suitable for our targeted metabolites, different combinations of methanol/ethanol (100%/0%, 80%/20%, 50%/50%, 20%/80%, and 0%/100%) were examined; they were added to the plasma sample at a ratio of plasma:solvent volume either 1:3 or 1:9 (Figure b).
PMC3708771	R01011	As summarized in Table  and in Additional file , maximum number of targeted metabolites were identified via the extraction step containing 20% methanol/ethanol with a plasma:solvent ratio of 1:3.
PMC3708771	R01015	In the condition of a 1:3 ratio, 300 μL of either methanol or ethanol was added to 100 μL of plasma; whereas in the setting of a 1:9 ratio, 900 μL of methanol or ethanol was added to 100 μL of plasma.
PMC3708771	R01016	In the aspect of biphasic deproteinization, a two-step solvent addition was introduced, starting with an addition of 100 μL chloroform with 200 μL of either methanol or ethanol to 200 μL of plasma, followed by an addition of 400 μL 50% chloroform/H_2 O. Metabolites extracted via both mono- and biphasic methods were subjected to a 1-minute vortexing, and a 20-minute incubation on ice.
PMC3708771	R01018	(b) To further optimize the step of monophasic deproteinization, various combinations of methanol/ethanol were prepared, and added to the plasma at a ratio of either 1:3 or 1:9 (plasma:solvent).
PMC3708771	R01019	Targeted human plasma metabolites identified in monophasic and biphasic deproteinizations Further in-depth optimization of monophasic deproteinization using different combinations of methanol/ethanol mix and plasma:solvent ratios of 1:3 and 1:9,
PMC3708771	R02000	According to the generic metabolite preparation protocol, once the sample is deproteinized with organic solvent, such as methanol, it will subsequently be subjected to lyophilization.
PMC3708771	R02002	In this regard, two sets of plasma samples were prepared and deproteinized with methanol in a ratio of 1:3 (plasma:methanol).
PMC3708771	R02004	Metabolites derived from both sets were then reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid/50% methanol and subjected to a static nanoelectrospray ionization coupled to an LTQ orbitrap XL hybrid fourier transform mass spectrometer (FTMS).
PMC3708771	R03000	Previous study by Evans and colleagues reported that 0.1% formic acid favored formation of the positive ions, but suppressed the negative ions.
PMC3708771	R03001	In this regard, ammonium bicarbonate was recommended as the reconstitution solvent in negative mode.
PMC3708771	R03002	Nonetheless, adapting two different reconstitution solvent involves an additional partition step to divide the plasma sample equally into two portions: one reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid for the positive mode; the other in ammonium bicarbonate for the negative mode.
PMC3708771	R03006	To evaluate the outcome of adapting ammonium bicarbonate vs. 0.1% formic acid as the reconstitution buffer in the negative mode, two sets of plasma samples were deproteinized and lyophilized as aforementioned.
PMC3708771	R03007	One set was reconstituted in 0.1% formic acid, whereas the other in 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate, both of which were then subjected to mass spectrometric analysis in the negative mode.
PMC3708771	R03008	As illustrated in Figure , 0.1% formic acid yielded greater signal than ammonium bicarbonate (2.29E4 vs. 3.49E3, respectively).
PMC3708771	R03010	Therefore, 0.1% formic acid was chosen as the reconstitution solvent.
PMC3708771	R03013	In the setting of 6.5 mM ammonium bicarbonate, the signal intensity was recorded as 3.49E3.
PMC3708771	R03015	In the setting of 0.1% formic acid, the signal was enhanced to 2.29E4, with an additional 108 peaks detected.
PMC3708771	R03016	Therefore, 0.1% formic acid was elected as the reconstitution solvent.
PMC3708771	R03017	Adapting the workflow we devised, we were able to retrieve most of our targeted metabolites, except L-lysine, uric acid, and citric acid.
PMC3735522	A00004	Proportionately higher amounts of butyrate were seen in stool of healthy individuals while relative concentrations of acetate were higher in stools of CRC patients.
PMC3735522	A00005	GC-MS profiling revealed higher concentrations of amino acids in stool samples from CRC patients and higher poly and monounsaturated fatty acids and ursodeoxycholic acid, a conjugated bile acid in stool samples from healthy adults (p<0.01).
PMC3735522	M01002	Exclusion criteria for all participants included use of antibiotics within two months of study participation, and regular use of NSAIDS, statins, or probiotics.
PMC3735522	M03001	The extract was dried using a speedvac, resuspended in 50 µL of pyridine containing 15 mg/mL of methoxyamine hydrochloride, incubated at 60°C for 45 min, sonicated for 10 min, and incubated for an additional 45 min at 60°C.
PMC3735522	R01017	Citrobacter farmeri , which can utilize citrate as a sole carbon source was also higher in samples from colon cancer patients, but represented a much smaller proportion of the total bacterial sequences.
PMC3735522	R02000	Short chain fatty acids (SCFA), particularly butyrate, are widely studied microbial metabolites reported to have anti-tumorigenic effects .
PMC3735522	R02002	We and others , have observed that species of butyrate producing bacteria, such as Ruminococcus spp .
PMC3735522	R02005	The three major SCFAs produced as microbial metabolites, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, were all detected as were valeric, isobutyric, isovaleric, caproic, and heptanoic acids.
PMC3735522	R02006	Among these, acetic and valeric acids were significantly higher in stool samples from CRC patients (p<0.0001 and p = 0.024 respectively) while butyric acid was significantly higher in the feces of healthy individuals (p<0.0001; ).
PMC3735522	R02007	No differences in propionic acid were detected between the two groups.
PMC3735522	R02008	Butyrate is regarded as one of the most important nutrients for normal colonocytes, and alone or in combination with propionate it has been shown to reduce proliferation and induce apotosis in human colon carcinomas .
PMC3735522	R02009	Although acetate is an important SCFA for maintaining colonic health and as a precurser molecule for endogenous cholesterol production, elevated levels of this metabolite have previously been associated with CRC in humans .
PMC3735522	R02010	Acetate can be used to produce butyrate and proportional differences in these metabolites between CRC and healthy samples may reflect a depletion of colonic microbes that can carry out this reaction in CRC samples or it may be a result of degradation of butyrate to acetate under low colonic pH associated with CRC.
PMC3735522	R02011	We also observed significantly higher relative concentrations of isobutyric (p<0.0001) and isovaleric acid (p = 0.002) in samples from individuals with CRC.
PMC3735522	R02012	These two SCFA’s result from bacterial metabolism of branched chain amino acids valine and leucine, which were also higher in CRC stool samples, and may account for the significant increases observed in these two SCFAs in the CRC population.
PMC3735522	R02013	Acetic acid, valeric acid, isobutyric acid, and isovaleric acid concentrations were proportionately higher while the anti-proliferative SCFA, butyric acid was significantly lower.
PMC3735522	R03007	An increased concentration of all amino acids except glutamine was previously reported in stomach and colon tumor tissues compared to healthy tissue .
PMC3735522	R03008	The authors hypothesized that tumor cells may exhibit increased glutaminase activity resulting in glutamine conversion to glutamate.
PMC3735522	R03009	Consistent with these findings, we also saw a large increase, approximately 76%, in glutamate without a corresponding increase in glutamine in stool samples from colon cancer patients.
PMC3735522	R03010	Another recent study using NMR to identify and detect metabolites from stool water extracts from healthy and CRC samples showed that the CRC samples had approximately 1.5-fold higher levels of cysteine, proline, and leucine .
PMC3735522	R03011	The increased concentrations of proline, serine, and threonine that were observed in CRC samples could also be the result from degradation of intestinal mucins, which are primarily comprised of glycoproteins rich in these amino acids .
PMC3735522	R03013	There were higher levels of glycerol as well as several unsaturated fatty acids detected in the stool samples of healthy individuals.
PMC3735522	R03014	Human cancer cells have a known transport system for the uptake of glycerol, suggesting stool glycerol may be lower in CRC because it is being taken up by the tumor cells.
PMC3735522	R03015	Alternatively, bacterial lipases present in healthy individuals may facilitate the metabolism of dietary and endogenously produced triacylglycerols, resulting in the final degradation products of glycerol and free fatty acids.
PMC3735522	R03016	In addition to glycerol, fatty acids most closely matching metabolomic signatures for linoleic acid, and stereoisomers of oleic acid were also higher in controls.
PMC3735522	R03017	Finally, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a secondary bile acid produced by intestinal bacteria was approximately 63% higher in healthy individuals compared to CRC.
PMC3735522	R03018	While several bile acids such as lithicolic acid and deoxycholic acid have been associated with tumorigenesis, UDCA has shown chemopreventive effects in preclinical and animal models of CRC .
PMC3735522	R03020	Bacteroides finegoldii, two Dialister spp. , and P. ruminis were strongly correlated, and Bacteroides intestinalis and Ruminococcus obeum were moderately correlated with increased stool free fatty acids and glycerol.
PMC3735522	R03021	These same bacteria were inversely associated with a cholesterol derivative and one or more of the amino acids that were overrepresented in stool samples from CRC patients.
PMC3735522	R03022	The two Ruminococcus spp. also showed a strong positive correlation with the presence of UDCA, in concurrence with previous reports that Ruminoccoccus species exhibit 7α- and 7β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities to produce this metabolite .
PMC3735522	R03023	Two of the bacterial genera overrepresented in CRC, Phascolarctobacterium and Acidiminobacter showed a strong positive association with the amino acids phenylalanine and glutamate, and were moderately correlated with increased serine and threonine.
PMC3735522	R03024	Glutamate can be utilized by these bacteria as a substrate, but their association with serine and threonine could also be indicative of involvement in mucin degradation or putrificative processes in the colon and warrant further study.

PMC3761963	R00000	The reversed-phase LC/MS untargeted metabolic profiling of a bacterial (Shewanella oneidensis ) response to nitric oxide stress revealed that the majority (~ 85 %, ) of the abundant, significantly dysregulated features were observed in the void volume or with minimal retention times (RT < 2 min).
PMC3761963	R00003	These results suggest that metabolic changes induced by nitric oxide treatment occur mainly in the highly polar cellular metabolome, most likely affecting the core network of central carbon metabolism.

PMC3761963	R00017	Initially, a range of concentrations (5, 10, 20, and 50 mM) of ammonium acetate and ammonium hydroxide mixture were tested.
PMC3761963	R00024	Based on these results, the optimum, high pH mobile phase conditions for HILIC/MS analyses using aminopropyl stationary phase were comprised of A = 10 mM NH_4 Ac and 10 mM NH_4 OH in 95 % water and B = 95 % acetonitrile, in both ESI positive and ESI negative modes.

PMC3846503	A02000	The NMR-based analysis showed increased unsaturated lipids and VLDL levels in both early and late IUGR samples, decreased glucose and increased acetone levels in early IUGR.
PMC3846503	A02001	Non-significant trends for decreased glucose and increased acetone levels were present in late IUGR, which followed a severity gradient when the VD and non-VD subgroups were considered.
PMC3846503	A02002	Regarding amino acids and derivatives, early IUGR showed significantly increased glutamine and creatine levels, whereas the amounts of phenylalanine and tyrosine were decreased in early and late-VD IUGR samples.
PMC3846503	A02003	Valine and leucine were decreased in late IUGR samples.
PMC3846503	A02004	Choline levels were decreased in all clinical subforms of IUGR.
PMC3846503	D00001	Using _1 H NMR, several metabolites were identified allowing a clear discrimination between IUGR and AGA samples, consisting in important increases in lipids, acetoacetate and decreased glucose levels.
PMC3846503	D00005	Our results are in agreement with previous reports of altered, pro-atherogenic lipid and cholesterol metabolism in IUGR fetuses [–].
PMC3846503	D00007	Furthermore, triglycerides (TGs) were found to be increased up to 33% in early-onset IUGR cases when compared to controls, which is consistent with previously published evidence [,–].
PMC3846503	D00008	The relevance of this finding relies on the fact that TGs act as an independent predictor of coronary artery disease which could, in association with the other lipid alterations found in this condition, potentially explain the proposed increased risk of cardiovascular disease in later life in IUGR cases.
PMC3846503	D00009	As to the nature of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms involved in these findings, abnormal lipid metabolism in IUGR could be explained by both chronic exposure to hypoxia and undernutrition: Hypoxic damage can induce significant derangements in plasmatic lipids during perinatal life resulting in hyperlipidemia and also increased cholesterol esters in hypoxia-cultured placental tissue.
PMC3846503	D00010	In addition, increased cholesterol levels are associated to starving conditions such as anorexia nervosa [,].
PMC3846503	D00014	In agreement with previous studies [,–], early-onset IUGR showed significant decreases in glucose levels and significant increases in ketones.
PMC3846503	D00016	Differences between early and late onset forms should be interpreted in line with previous findings in which glucose levels were inversely correlated to the clinical severity of IUGR [,,].
PMC3846503	D00017	As to the mechanisms involved in these findings, it is known that growth restricted fetuses maintain lower glucose concentrations to increase transplacental glucose gradient, which will keep the glucose uptake across the placenta of limited size.
PMC3846503	D00020	Glutamine levels were found to be increased in early IUGRs as compared with matched controls.
PMC3846503	D00022	Glutamine concentration in fetal blood depends on the transfer from maternal blood but also on placental synthesis.
PMC3846503	D00023	Fetal glutamine is next to glucose as one of the main sources of cellular energy in fetal life.
PMC3846503	D00024	It also plays a key role in fetal neurodevelopment being a precursor of alpha-amino butyric acid, a neurotransmission inhibitor.
PMC3846503	D00025	Increased glutamine levels in severe IUGR could be explained by the inherent hypercatabolic status of this condition, in association to decreased glucose levels [,].
PMC3846503	D00026	This lack of energy substrates may convey to increase glutamine supply to the fetus through different mechanisms.
PMC3846503	D00027	When the different late-IUGR subsets were considered in regard to glutamine levels, thought-provoking differences were found: while vasodilated late-IUGR cases did not show any significant change, there was a significant decrease in the non-vasodilated late-IUGR cases.
PMC3846503	D00029	However, this finding could be understood in the light of other pathologies with decreased glutamine levels such as in chronic stress conditions [,].
PMC3846503	D00030	It is tempting to speculate that similar mechanisms may be involved here; whereas an overexposure to glucocorticoids is involved in chronic stress, it may as well play an important role in this clinical subform of IUGR.
PMC3846503	D00031	Indeed, increased corticosteroid transfer to the fetus has long been suggested as a potential pathogenic pathway of IUGR in humans [,].
PMC3846503	D00032	Increased creatine levels in early IUGR could be interpreted as well by a metabolic-substrate deficient condition.
PMC3846503	D00033	Creatine is an essential metabolite for energy metabolism through the production of ATP and increased levels have been reported in preterm IUGR neonates in IUGR-induced gilts.
PMC3846503	D00034	Phenylalanine and tyrosine levels were decreased similarly in early and late vasodilated IUGR cases.
PMC3846503	D00035	Tyrosine is synthesized from the essential amino acid phenylalanine.
PMC3846503	D00036	Previously published results from in vitro and in vivo studies on phenylalanine in IUGR conditions have yielded controversial information [,,,], which could be explained by important differences in the selection of IUGR cases included.
PMC3846503	D00037	In general, studies focusing on early-onset severe IUGR cases showed decreased phenylalanine levels, attributed to an altered placental transport, plausibly resulting from a “damaged” placental tissue and the inherent hypercatabolic state in IUGR [,].
PMC3846503	D00038	The observation of a similar decrease in phenylalanine in the group of vasodilated late-IUGR fetuses could support the hypothesis that this clinical subset represents a late form of placental insufficiency.
PMC3846503	D00039	The implications of decreased phenylalanine and tyrosine as neurotransmitter precursors in these clinical forms, both associated with adverse neurological outcome [,–], deserves further investigation.
PMC3846503	D00040	Finally, non-vasodilated late IUGR was associated with a remarkably distinct response in relation with phenylalanine and tyrosine suggesting a more prominent role of other mechanisms as discussed above.
PMC3846503	D00041	Leucine and valine were significantly decreased in both forms of late IUGR regardless the presence or absence of brain vasodilation, but not in early IUGR.
PMC3846503	D00042	Valine and leucine, together with isoleucine, are defined as branched-chain amino acids (BCAA).
PMC3846503	D00047	However, exposure to increased glucocorticoids has similar effects to food restriction on BCAA aminotransferase and other enzymes regulating the catabolism and plasma concentrations of these amino acids.
PMC3846503	D00050	Decreased choline concentrations were found in all IUGR subsets, with a progression across clinical severity in early (25.7% decrease), vasodilated late (18.7%) and non-vasodilated late IUGR cases (9%).
PMC3846503	D00051	Choline is an essential metabolite under a high demand during pregnancy.
PMC3846503	D00053	Circulating choline has also been reported to be reduced under malnutrition and reductions in IUGR could be due to impaired transplacental supply.
PMC3846503	D00054	However, this does not exclude other pathways, since reduced serum levels have also been described in response to glucocorticoid therapy and chronic stress.
PMC3846503	D00055	Choline has a key role in neurodevelopment, being the precursor of phosphatidylcholine for myelinization.
PMC3846503	D00059	The potential role of choline deficiency in these long term effects deserves further investigation.
PMC3846503	D00077	Besides major and common changes found in most IUGR cases, such as increased lipids and decreased glucose, amino acid changes may bring insight to specific mechanisms involved in this disease.
PMC3846503	M01009	Control subjects were singleton appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) fetuses (birth weight >10_th centile according to local standards) that were matched with cases by gestational age at delivery (± 7 days) and gender.
PMC3846503	M04008	Chemical shifts were referenced internally to the CH_3 resonance of alanine at 1.47 ppm.
PMC3846503	R00005	Administration of antibiotics (amoxicillin-clavulanic, penicillin, erythromycin, ampicillin and gentamicin were most commonly used) and tocolytic agents (ritodrine, nifedipine or atosiban as most commonly used) as a consequence of premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and preterm labour were significantly higher in preterm controls.
PMC3846503	R02005	In the case of the control sample singled out as outlier, it presented very intense glucose signals that overshadowed the rest of the NMR spectrum, which was compatible with the maternal diagnosis of suboptimally controlled gestational diabetes.
PMC3846503	R02008	These signals were identified as exogenous to the biological samples and assigned to the EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) used as anticoagulant in the collection tubes[].
PMC3846503	R02014	For this particular model, the NMR signals that primarily contributed to the clustering of the IUGR cases were mainly located between 0.80-1.35 ppm (appearing on the right half of the loadings plot), an NMR region characteristic of lipids, lactate and the methyl groups from amino acids such as valine, leucine, isoleucine and threonine.
PMC3846503	R02015	The differentiation of the control samples arises from NMR buckets in the region 3.20-4.00 ppm (, left half), which correspond to metabolites like α/β-glucose or the alpha and beta hydrogen atoms of most amino acids.
PMC3846503	R02016	Likewise, a bucket at 5.22 ppm attributable to the H1 of α-glucose, also contributed significantly to the discrimination of the control samples.
PMC3846503	R02017	Therefore, a qualitative interpretation of the loadings plot pointed to glucose as a relevant metabolite in the early IUGR cases/controls differentiation.
PMC3846503	R02059	The buckets presenting the largest increases when cases are compared with controls were correlated with various lipid molecules, whereas the highest metabolite reductions were observed for buckets related to α/β-glucose.
PMC3846503	R02064	Among these variations the largest changes were observed for signals at 1.26 ppm (LDL+VLDL), 1.56 ppm (VLDL, triglycerides, CH_2 -CO), 2.20 ppm (triglycerides, CH_2 -CO) and 5.23-5.33 ppm (unsaturated lipids).
PMC3846503	R02065	Another signal that appears more intense in the IUGR subject samples (64% increase) is that corresponding with the methyl of ketone groups at 2.21 ppm (acetone/acetoacetate).
PMC3846503	R02067	15%) are observed for creatine and glutamine.
PMC3846503	R02068	Regarding metabolite reductions, the levels of glucose are decreased (NMR signals at 5.22 and 3.90-3.40 ppm) for early IUGR cases compared to controls, with an average negative variation of 25%.
PMC3846503	R02069	Similar metabolite reductions are observed for choline and slightly lower for phenylalanine.
PMC3846503	R02087	LDL: low density lipoproteins; VLDL: very-low density lipoproteins; NAC: acetyl signals from glycoproteins.
PMC3846503	R02089	Other metabolic differences have been reported in previous IUGR studies [,,], involving molecules such as arginine, proline, glycine, serine, threonine, myo -inositol, sarcosine and creatinine.
PMC3846503	R03011	Glucose levels were again slightly decreased (-5.8%) but the result could not be considered statistically significant.
PMC3846503	R03012	Other metabolites found relevant in the early subset study (acetone/acetoacetate, creatine, phenylalanine) did not present any significant difference in the late subset analysis.
PMC3846503	R03013	Although with relatively modest numbers, a particular case is presented by the amino acid glutamine which showed a 14.8% increase in the early IUGR cases, but a decrease of nearly 10% for the late IUGR subjects compared to the control samples.
PMC3846503	R03014	Similar reductions in metabolite levels were also observed for choline, alanine, valine, tyrosine and leucine.
PMC3846503	R03030	In addition, decreases in the amounts of the amino acids choline, phenylalanine, tyrosine and valine were observed for the vasodilated late-onset IUGR cases relative to the control samples ( and ).
PMC3846503	R03054	Phenylalanine.
PMC3846503	R03056	The comparison of metabolic levels rendered small positive variations for lipids/VLDL (, up to 17%) and minor reductions of the metabolites choline, glutamine, valine, leucine and alanine ( and ).

PMC3901292	R01000	Metabolite assignment was facilitated by the use of the simplified 2D HSQC spectra using the chromatographic fractions along with our current library of chemical shift values from _15 N-ethanolamine derivatized standards of carboxyl containing metabolites.
PMC3901292	R01003	The chemical shift values were found to be quite consistent for such comparisons as long as an internal standard (such as derivatized maleic acid in this work) was used for referencing.
PMC3901292	R01006	Each control sample contained an equimolar amount of maleic acid, used as a referencing standard.
PMC3901292	R01007	All samples were then derivatized with _15 N-ethanolamine and 2D HSQC experiments were then performed.
PMC3901292	R01014	We also investigated the quantitative abilities of our derivatization and LC-NMR method using glutamic acid in a bio-fluid matrix.
PMC3901292	R01015	L-glutamic acid, a key molecule in cellular metabolism, has signals that are difficult to detect without ambiguity in the _1 H-NMR spectrum of human urine owing to extensive peak overlap and its low concentration.
PMC3901292	R01016	A calibration curve generated by standard addition of _15 N isotope labeled glutamic acid into a sample of derivatized urine shows a good linear relationship between the concentration of derivatized L-glutamic acid and the NMR peak area with a coefficient of regression (R_2 ) of ~0.99.
PMC3901292	R01033	Significant improvements in the limits of detection can be inferred from the assignment of β-alanine, which has typical levels in urine of healthy adults of the order of a few µM, thus, making its detection in bio-fluids rather difficult by standard NMR.

PMC3946369	A01009	Bioactivity-guided fractionation of this extract provided a new epitetrathiodioxopiperizine, named secoemestrin D (1), and five new sesterterpenes, emericellenes A–E (2–6), together with sterigmatocystin (7), arugosin C (8), and epiisoshamixanthone (9) of which 1 and 7 were found to be cytotoxic.

PMC3946369	R00005	The presence of signals due to a dihydrooxepine moiety [δ_H 6.58 (1H, brd, J = 1.6 Hz), δ_c 138.6 (CH); δ_H 6.28 (1H, dd, J = 2.4, 8.0 Hz), δ_c 139.4 (CH); δ_H 4.82 (1H, dd, J = 2.0, 8.4 Hz), δ_c 106.6 (CH); δ_H 5.46 (1H, ddd, J = 2.0, 2.4, 8.4 Hz), δ_c 71.5 (CH); δ_H 5.33 (1H, dd, J = 2.0, 8.4 Hz), δ_c 61.7 (CH); and δ_c 108.2 (C)], and a prominent peak at m/z 465 (C_19 H_17 N_2 O_4 S_4 ) in the HREIMS due to the facile loss of the hydroxy and methoxy-substituted benzoic acid moiety from [M + H]_+ suggested that the structure of 1 closely resembled that of secoemestrin C_1 .
PMC3946369	R00006	The _1 H NMR spectrum of 1 also exhibited signals due to a 1,3,4-trisubstituted benzene ring [δ 7.81 (1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz), 6.98 (1H, d, J = 8.8 Hz), and 7.85 (1H, dd, J = 8.4, 2.0 Hz)], a 1,4-disubstituted benzene ring [δ 6.74 (2H, d, J = 8.4 Hz), 7.08 (1H, d, J = 8.4 Hz)], a benzylic methylene attached to a chiral center [δ 3.23 and 3.96 (1H each, d, J = 14.8 Hz)], an allylic methylene [δ 3.12 (m)], an OMe (δ 4.01) and an NMe (δ 3.19) groups.
PMC3946369	R00007	The dihydrooxepine and epitetrathiodioxopiperazine partial structures and all the above moieties were joined together with the help of HMBC correlations suggesting that secoemestrin D is an epitetrathiodioxopiperizine analogue with the gross structure as depicted in 1.
PMC3946369	R00013	These data suggested that 2 is a bicyclic sesterterpenoid bearing a CHO attached to a tertiary carbon.
PMC3946369	R00019	The HMBC correlations of each of the CH_2 protons of this terminal oxirane moiety to C-11 and C-13 and H-11 to the remaining carbon (C-12) of this moiety suggested that the terminal CH_2 of the spin system A is connected to the CH terminal of the spin system C via C-12 generating a [9,3,1] bicarbocyclic ring similar to that of verticillane-type diterpenenoids.
PMC3946369	R00020	However, the presence of the spin system D at C-15 suggested that 2 is a sesterterpenoid containing a new emericellane-type skeleton.
PMC3946369	R00023	Strong NOE correlations observed between one of the CH_2 protons of the terminal oxirane and H-9α, H-9α with H-7α, and H-7α with H-11α suggested that this oxirane is of β-orientation.
PMC3946369	R00032	Comparison of _1 H and _13 C NMR data of emericellene C (4) with those of 3 suggested that in 4 the terminal oxirane moiety of 3 [δ_H 2.74 and 2.41 (each 1H, d, J = 4.0 Hz); δ_C 50.2 (CH_2 ) and 57.6 (C)] is replaced by a CH_2 OH moiety on a double bond [δ_H 4.21 (2H, s) and 5.83 (1H, br d, J = 2.4 Hz); δ_C 65.4 (CH_2 ), 139.1 (C), and 121.4 (CH)] suggesting that the 12,17-oxirane in 3 has undergone a ring opening reaction with concomitant rearrangement to a 12,13-en-17-ol moiety giving rise to 4 (for probable biosynthetic pathway from 3 to 4, see ).
PMC3946369	R00036	The _1 H and _13 C NMR spectroscopic data of emericellene D (5) and comparison of these data with those of 3 revealed absence of the signals due to the terminal oxirane moiety, but the presence of a CH–CHO moiety [δ_H 9.77 (1H, d, J = 4.8 Hz); δ_C 204.8 (CH) and δ_H 2.44 (m); δ_C 53.7 (CH)] suggesting that the 12,17-epoxide moiety in 3 has undergone a concomitant ring opening and rearrangement to an aldehyde moiety (for probable biosynthetic pathway from 3 to 5, see ).

PMC3955250	A00002	Here we studied the utility of the androgen precursor serum androstenedione (A) in conjunction with serum T for predicting metabolic dysfunction in PCOS.
PMC3955250	A01000	Eighty-six PCOS patients fulfilling Rotterdam diagnostic consensus criteria and 43 age- and body mass index-matched controls underwent measurement of serum androgens by tandem mass spectrometry and an oral glucose tolerance test with homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and insulin sensitivity index calculation.
PMC3955250	A02006	Multiple linear regression showed a strong negative association between serum androstenedione and insulin sensitivity.
PMC3955250	A02007	The incidence of dysglycemia according to an oral glucose tolerance test increased with the severity of androgen phenotype (NA/NT, 0%; HA/NT, 14%; HA/HT, 25%, P = .03).
PMC3955250	A04010	Androgen excess in PCOS originates from the ovaries and adrenals; moreover, increased peripheral conversion of T to the most potent androgen 5α-dihydrotestosterone by systemically up-regulated 5α-reductase activity has been well documented (, ).
PMC3955250	A04011	Androstenedione (A) is the immediate precursor of T.
PMC3955250	A04012	In addition to direct secretion by ovaries and adrenals, A can be generated in peripheral tissues from its precursor dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) by the enzyme 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2.

PMC3955250	M02003	Serum steroid oxime analysis, which facilitates enhanced detection by formation of oxime derivatives of the steroid oxogroups, was used for the measurement of T, A, and DHEA and carried out in positive mode, whereas the measurement of serum DHEAS was performed in negative mode.
PMC3955250	M02004	T, A, and DHEA were extracted from 200 μL serum via liquid-liquid extraction using 1 mL tert-butyl-methyl-ether followed by derivatization into steroid oximes using 100 μL derivatization mixture (0.16 g hydroxylamine in 8 mL pyridine).
PMC3955250	M02005	For protein precipitation and extraction of DHEAS, 20 μL ZnSO_4 , 0.1 mM, and 100 μL acetonitrile were added to 20 μL serum before evaporation under constant nitrogen flow.
PMC3955250	M02006	All steroids were separated using an optimized gradient system consisting of methanol with 0.1% formic acid and quantified referring to a linear calibration series with appropriate internal standards.
PMC3955250	M02014	The sum of androsterone (An) and etiocholanolone (Et) was considered representative of active androgen metabolite excretion.
PMC3955250	M02015	Net systemic 5α-reductase activity was assessed by the ratios of An to Et and 5α-tetrahydrocortisol to tetrahydrocortisol (5α-THF/THF).
PMC3955250	M02016	11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11β-HSD1) activity was estimated using the ratio of the tetrahydrometabolites of cortisol (5α-THF + THF) to tetrahydrocortisone (THE), and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11β-HSD2) activity by the ratio of free urinary cortisol to cortisone.
PMC3955250	M02017	Total glucocorticoid metabolite excretion was assessed as the sum of 5α-THF + THF + THE + cortolones + cortols + cortisol + cortisone.
PMC3955250	R00010	Normal glucose tolerance was a 2-hour glucose OGTT 7.7 mmol/

PMC3955250	R01005	Androgen and glucocorticoid metabolites were measured by GC/MS.
PMC3955250	R01021	Similarly, serum DHEA and DHEAS were significantly higher in HA/HT and HA/NT patients as compared with the NA/NT group and the controls (, E and F).
PMC3955250	R01023	Total androgen metabolites (A), HOMA-IR (B), ISI (C), fasting insulin (D), serum DHEA (E), and DHEAS (F) in the three androgen phenotype PCOS subgroups and healthy controls.
PMC3955250	R02000	Overall, PCOS patients had higher fasting insulin and HOMA-IR values than BMI-matched controls, but fasting glucose and 2-hour values did not differ significantly.
PMC3955250	R02002	BMI was positively correlated with FAI (R = 0.4, P < .0001) and systemic 5α-reductase activity (An/Et, R = 0.21, P = .01; 5α-THF + THF, R = 0.20, P = .02).
PMC3955250	R02007	On multiple linear regression analysis, a significant negative association was confirmed only between A and ISI [coefficient −2.69, 95% confidence interval (CI) −1.57 to −3.81, P < .0001, Supplemental Table 1, published on The Endocrine Society's Journals Online web site at http://jcem.endojournals.org]; no such association was observed between ISI and serum T, DHEAS, or DHEA.
PMC3955250	R03001	The android to gynecoid ratio was strongly correlated with HOMA-IR (R = 0.53, P < .0001), FAI (R = 0.37, P < .0001), An/Et

PMC3955250	R04002	Urinary glucocorticoid excretion appeared to gradually increase with the degree of androgen excess, with significantly higher levels in the HA/HT group than in controls.
PMC3955250	R04003	On multiple linear regression (Supplemental Table 1), total glucocorticoid excretion was a negative predictor of ISI (coefficient −0.003, 95% CI −0.001 to −0.005, P = .048).
PMC3963402	A00000	Clandestine laboratories constantly produce new synthetic cannabinoids to circumvent legislative efforts, complicating toxicological analysis.
PMC3963402	A00001	No extensive synthetic cannabinoid quantitative urinary methods are reported in the literature.

PMC3963402	D00000	Despite initial DEA scheduling of synthetic cannabinoids in March 2011, abuse is an ongoing problem, with the 2012 Monitoring the Future survey reporting that 11.3% of 12_th graders ingested synthetic cannabinoids in the past year.
PMC3963402	D00001	Another recent survey of undergraduate students at a southeastern university found 14% students reported lifetime synthetic cannabinoid use.
PMC3963402	D00002	A validated and sensitive LC-MS/MS method for simultaneously quantifying synthetic cannabinoids and metabolites in urine is necessary for confirming intake by clinical and forensic laboratories.
PMC3963402	D00003	Few quantitative urinary synthetic cannabinoids methods exist; most published LC-MS/MS quantitative methods target JWH-018 and JWH-073 metabolites after β-glucuronidase hydrolysis [–].
PMC3963402	D00004	We present a fully validated and sensitive quantitative LC-MS/MS method for simultaneously measuring the most comprehensive synthetic cannabinoid panel to-date in urine.
PMC3963402	D00005	This quantitative synthetic cannabinoid method is useful for evaluating cutoff concentrations to optimally document synthetic cannabinoid intake, for determining windows of synthetic cannabinoid detection and identifying optimal synthetic cannabinoid analytes for documenting recent intake.
PMC3963402	D00006	Our goal during validation of the current method was to assess whether more β-glucuronidase enzyme was required to achieve similarly optimal hydrolysis as this method requires a larger 200 µL urine volume compared to 100 µL urine for the previous validated synthetic cannabinoid screening method.
PMC3963402	D00007	We evaluated JWH-018 N-5-hydroxypentyl-glucuronide, the only synthetic cannabinoid glucuronide metabolite reference standard commercially available at the time of method development, for evaluating the effect of increasing urine volume on hydrolysis efficiency, as we did not have fresh authentic specimens.
PMC3963402	D00008	Using the current method’s hydrolysis conditions achieved similar JWH-018 N-5-hydroxypentyl-glucuronide hydrolysis as observed during development of the previous qualitative synthetic cannabinoid assay inferring that the current conditions would also achieve optimal hydrolysis of JWH-073, JWH-122, JWH-210, JWH-250, AM2201 and RCS-4 metabolites.
PMC3963402	D00009	It is unknown whether these hydrolysis conditions are optimal for other synthetic cannabinoid glucuronide conjugates.
PMC3963402	D00010	Previously, de Jager et al. presented a synthetic cannabinoid urinary method targeting JWH-018 N-5-hydroxypentyl, JWH-018 N-pentanoic acid, JWH-019 5-hydroxyindole, JWH-073 N-4-hydroxybutyl, JWH-073 N-butanoic acid, JWH-122 N-5-hydroxypentyl, JWH-200 5-hydroxyindole, JWH-250 5-hydroxyindole, JWH-250 N-5-carboxypentyl, JWH-398 N-hydroxypentyl and RCS-4 N-5-hydroxypentyl metabolites.
PMC3963402	D00018	Our method was unable to achieve baseline chromatographic resolution for alkyl hydroxy metabolite isomers (i.e. JWH-018 N-2, N-3, N-4, and N-5-hydroxypentyl compounds have similar retention times) providing semi-quantitative total alkyl hydroxy metabolite concentrations for any synthetic cannabinoid.
PMC3963402	D00019	This is a potential limitation for distinguishing the synthetic cannabinoid ingested, as AM2201 metabolically forms JWH-018 N-5-hydroxypentyl with minimal JWH-018 N-4-hydroxypentyl, and JWH-018 forms less JWH-018 N-5-hydroxypentyl than JWH-018 N-4-hydroxypentyl.
PMC3963402	D00020	Our quantitative method includes the AM2201 specific metabolites AM2201 N-4-hydroxypentyl and AM2201 6-hydroxyindole, but these compounds are less abundant than JWH-018 N-5-hydroxypentyl after AM2201 intake.
PMC3963402	D00021	We added JWH-018 N-5-hydroxypentyl, JWH-019 N-6-hydroxyhexyl, JWH-073 N-4-hydroxybutyl, JWH-081 N-5-hydroxypentyl, JWH-122 N-5-hydroxypentyl, JWH-210 N-5-hydroxypentyl, JWH-250 N-5-hydroxypentyl, JWH-398 N-5-hydroxypentyl, AM2201 N-4-hydroxypentyl, MAM2201 N-4-hydroxypentyl, RCS-4 N-5-hydroxypentyl
PMC3963402	D00022	and UR-144 N-5-hydroxypentyl alkyl hydroxy metabolite standards, but since isomeric separation was not possible, we can only identify these peaks as alkyl hydroxy metabolites without assigning hydroxy position on the side chain.
PMC3963402	D00025	Poor availability of analytical reference standards impedes method development for synthetic cannabinoids and other emerging drugs of abuse.
PMC3963402	D00028	There was one exception for this internal standard selection scheme; we selected deuterated JWH-018 parent analyte as an internal standard for JWH-210 5-hydroxyindole after observing poor QC performance with JWH-018 5-hydroxyindole-d_9 as internal standard.
PMC3963402	D00030	-elutes with JWH-210 5-hydroxyindole better accounting for matrix effect.
PMC3963402	D00035	We are uncertain why >100 µg/l JWH-250 N-5-carboxypentyl concentrations interfered with JWH-210 5-hydroxyindole quantification at 0.6 µg/l. JWH-210 5-hydroxyindole ion ratio criteria were within 80–120% of target, but the low QC quantified at 193% of target.
PMC3963402	D00037	It also seems unlikely that JWH-250 N-5-carboxypentyl would be converted to JWH-210 5-hydroxyindole during sample preparation or analysis.
PMC3963402	D00038	JWH-250 N-5-carboxypentyl standard may have a trace JWH-210 5-hydroxyindole impurity.
PMC3963402	D00039	False positive results could occur when both JWH-250 N-5-carboxypentyl and JWH-210 5-hydroxyindole co-occur in specimens, presence of JWH-210 N-hydroxypentyl and/or JWH-210 N-5-carboxypentyl is required for documenting JWH-210 intake.
PMC3963402	D00041	Similarly, Dresen et al. showed >15% JWH-073, JWH-081 and methandamide decreases in fortified serum after 72 h and we previously showed THC instability in urine after 16h at room temperature.
PMC3963402	D00043	Parent analyte instability may partially explain not detecting parent synthetic cannabinoids in urine.
PMC3963402	D00044	We present a fully-validated quantitative LC-MS/MS method for the most comprehensive synthetic cannabinoid urine method to-date targeting 53 analytes: JWH-018, JWH-019, JWH-073, JWH-081, JWH-122, JWH-200, JWH-210, JWH-250, JWH-398, RCS-4, AM2201, MAM2201, UR-144, CP 47,497-C7, CP 47,497-C8 and their metabolites, and JWH-203, AM694, RCS8, XLR11 and HU210 parent compounds.

PMC4012283	D00001	Although most patients with FESZ received medication and should be carefully considered, two independent sample sets were analyzed and increased levels of creatine, and decreased levels of betaine, nonanoic acid, benzoic acid and perillic acid were identified in patients with FESZ.
PMC4012283	D00002	By quantifying the absolute concentration of major metabolites, the changes in the concentrations of three metabolites (creatine, gluconic acid and betaine) were validated in patients with FESZ.
PMC4012283	D00004	Betaine (trimethylglycine) serves as an osmoregulator and is a substrate in the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase reaction, which converts homocysteine to methionine.
PMC4012283	D00005	In human tissues, this reaction is essential for homocysteine metabolism and methyl-donor transportation pathways, such as DNA methylation.
PMC4012283	D00006	Excess homocysteine in the brain leads to elevated oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine level, and eventually to neural toxicity and microvascular damage._, Congenital homocystinuria is similarly associated with systemic illnesses such as thrombosis, osteoporosis, mental retardation and sometimes, psychotic symptoms._, Betaine supplements have been used in the treatment of congenital homocystinuria and have also been shown effective in reduction of hyperhomocysteinemia in healthy individuals.
PMC4012283	D00007	_, The C677T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene is a risk factor for hyperhomocysteinemia_, and is associated with psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorders, depression_, and schizophrenia.
PMC4012283	D00008	In this study, patients with FESZ demonstrated a significantly decreased betaine concentration in both data sets (first set and second set).
PMC4012283	D00009	Interestingly, in the first set, reduced betaine was associated with severe positive symptoms.
PMC4012283	D00011	Although future studies are needed to discover the reason(s) underlying the decreased betaine concentration in patients with FESZ, decreased methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase function and/or aberrant homocysteine synthesis may result in the downregulation of a betaine-related pathway in schizophrenia.
PMC4012283	D00012	Nonanoic acid is a nine-carbon, chained, monocarboxylic acid, and occurs naturally as an ester in the oil made from pelargonium .
PMC4012283	D00013	Although little is known regarding the action of nonanoic acid in humans, nonanoic acid is a family of medium-chain fatty acids including valproic acid, which is used to treat manic symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.
PMC4012283	D00014	One possible common role for mood stabilizers, including valproic acid, is a reduction in the inositol phosphate level through inhibition of PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase).
PMC4012283	D00015	_, Interestingly, nonanoic acid inhibits PI3K activity more than valproic acid.
PMC4012283	D00016	The finding that patients with FESZ have reduced concentrations of nonanoic acid suggests that abnormal inositol phosphate signaling may have a role in schizophrenia.
PMC4012283	D00017	Glutamate is an amino acid and is well known as the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain.
PMC4012283	D00019	However, glutamate levels measured in peripheral blood samples from patients with schizophrenia have been inconsistent across studies, in that some studies have reported increased levels, nonsignificant changes_, or decreased levels.
PMC4012283	D00020	Longitudinal studies have shown that blood glutamate levels increase during the clinical course of antipsychotics medication and clinical improvement.
PMC4012283	D00021	Results from the current study showed trends toward increased plasma glutamate levels in patients with FESZ.
PMC4012283	D00022	In addition, current results showed an association between the level of glutamate and benzodiazepine equivalent doses.
PMC4012283	D00023	Because medication doses were significantly associated with the severity of symptoms at onset, and there was no difference in glutamate concentration with benzodiazepine treatment in the second set, it is difficult to conclude that medications directly affect the glutamate concentration in peripheral blood.
PMC4012283	D00024	More studies are necessary to fully elucidate the relationship between medication and glutamate concentrations.
PMC4012283	D00025	Previous studies have shown that a marked spike in the serum creatine kinase level, the so-called PACK (schizophrenia-associated creatine kinase-emia), occurs especially at the onset of schizophrenia.
PMC4012283	D00026	PACK was obscured in chronic stages of schizophrenia, suggesting that the leak of creatine kinase from muscle to blood occurred especially around the onset of schizophrenia.
PMC4012283	D00027	_, The current results showed that the creatine concentration in patients with FESZ increased compared with controls and was negatively associated with DUP.
PMC4012283	D00028	These results suggest that patients showed altered creatine metabolism only proximate to the onset of schizophrenia.
PMC4012283	D00029	Furthermore, preliminary results showed that an increased creatine concentration was associated with severe symptoms at 6 months.
PMC4012283	D00030	As DUP was one of the most promising outcome indicators for schizophrenia, the plasma creatine concentration and its changes in schizophrenia may be a potential biomarker used to detect clinical stage and to predict symptomatic outcome.
PMC4012283	D00034	However, consistent differences could not be detected when Mann–Whitney U- tests were used to compare patients using antipsychotics, benzodiazepines or anti-parkinsonian agents and patients not using medications.
PMC4012283	D00040	Patients with FESZ had increased levels of creatine, and decreased levels of betaine, nonanoic acid, benzoic acid and perillic acid.
PMC4012283	D00041	Although most patients with FESZ received medication, altered levels of these metabolites were specific in patients with FESZ, and consistent with well-known hypotheses regarding abnormalities of the homocysteine metabolism, PACK and oxidative stress.
PMC4012283	M00011	The exclusion criteria were presence or history of neurological illness, traumatic brain injury with any known cognitive consequences or loss of consciousness for >5 min, a history of electroconvulsive therapy, low premorbid IQ (<70), previous history of alcohol addiction, previous continuous illegal substance use (for example, cannabis) and clearly diagnosed as ASD and dissociative disorders.
PMC4012283	M00014	If the patients were being treated with antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and/or anti-Parkinsonian agents, doses were calculated as equivalent doses of chlorpromazine, diazepam and biperiden, respectively.
PMC4012283	M01003	Plasma samples (100 μl) were plunged into 0.45 ml methanol containing 10 μM each methionine sulfone and 10-camphorsulfonic acid and mixed well.
PMC4012283	M01004	Then, 200 μl deionized water and 0.5 ml chloroform were added and the solution was centrifuged at 2300 g for 5 min at 4 °C.
PMC4012283	R01004	Of the nine metabolites identified in the first set, patients with FESZ had a significant increase in creatine (P =0.031) and significant decreases in betaine, nonanoic acid, benzoic acid and perillic acid (P =0.029, 0.00031, 0.039, 0.0040, respectively) in the second set (,).
PMC4012283	R01006	Of the remaining four metabolites identified in the first set, two metabolites showed similar trends in patients with FESZ in the second set (glutamate, P =0.064 and gluconic acid, P =0.052) and two (imidazoleacetic acid and cyclohexylamine) were not detected in either diagnostic group in the second set.
PMC4012283	R01015	Of the nine significant altered metabolites listed in the first set, four metabolites (creatine, glutamate, gluconic acid, and betaine) were included as pre-determined major metabolites in the CE-TOFMS analysis procedure.
PMC4012283	R01017	The concentrations of creatine, gluconic acid and betaine were significantly different between the FESZ and control groups (P =0.011, 0.0043 and 0.00013, respectively, ) and the concentration of glutamate showed a similar trend (P =0.25, ).
PMC4012283	R02000	In the first set, step-wise discriminant analysis between the FESZ and control groups showed that the diagnosis of 87.5% (28/32) of the subjects could be correctly classified using three metabolites (betaine, glutamate and nonanoic acid; Wilks' λ =0.417, P <0.001).
PMC4012283	R02003	Correlation analysis showed that creatine and glutamate could be affected by medications (assessed below).
PMC4012283	R02004	Therefore, the same discriminant analyses were conducted without creatine and glutamate.
PMC4012283	R02005	Step-wise discriminant analysis in the first set showed that the diagnosis of 81.2% (26/32) of the subjects could be correctly classified using three metabolites (betaine, gluconic acid and nonanoic acid; Wilks' λ =0.449, P <0.001).
PMC4012283	R03000	The correlational analysis using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients in the first (two-tailed), second (one-tailed) and combination sets (two-tailed) showed significant correlations between plasma glutamate and the diazepam equivalent dose (first: ρ =0.688, P =0.0016; second: ρ =0.657, P =0.010; combination: ρ =0.613, P =0.00032, ) and between plasma creatine and logDUP (first: ρ =−0.603, P =0.0077; second: ρ =−0.606, P =0.018; combination: ρ =−0.617, P =0.00028, ).
PMC4012283	R03001	Linear regression analysis using the combination set showed that creatine concentration was separately predicted by chlorpromazine dose and logDUP (chlorpromazine: β =0.35
PMC4012283	R03003	In the first set, reduced betaine was associated with severe positive symptoms (ρ =−0.527, P =0.024), but this correlation was not replicated in the second set nor combination set.
PMC4012283	R03005	(a) Correlation between glutamate concentration and diazepam equivalent dose (ρ =0.613, P =0.0003).
PMC4012283	R03006	(b) Correlation between creatine concentration and logarithm DUP (ρ =−0.617, P =0.0003).
PMC4012283	R03008	Preliminary analysis showed that the creatine concentration was correlated with the PANSS general psychopathology subscore (ρ =0.763, P =0.0063) and with the PANSS total score (ρ =0.624, P =0.040).
PMC4012283	R03009	In addition, concentrations of nonanoic acid and perillic acid were correlated with the PANSS general psychopathology subscore (ρ =0.671, P =0.024 and ρ =0.639, P =0.034, respectively).
PMC4012283	R04000	We divided the patients with schizophrenia into two subgroups whether patients used antipsychotics or not, and also made subgroups in accordance with usage of benzodiazepines and anti-parkinsonian, respectively.
PMC4012283	R04001	In the first set, glutamate concentration in the patients using benzodiazepines (n =8) was significantly lower than that in the patients using no benzodiazepine (n =10, U =12.0, P =0.012).
PMC4012283	R04002	In the second set, any significant change was not shown between patients using antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, anti-Parkinsonian drugs or not.
PMC4012283	R04003	In absolute concentration analysis of four metabolites, glutamate concentration in the patients using benzodiazepines (n =17) was significantly lower than that in the patients using no benzodiazepine (n =13, U =51.0, P =0.012).
PMC4012283	R04004	Glutamate concentration in the patients using anti-parkinsonian (n =13) was also significantly lower than that in the patients using no anti-parkinsonian (n =17, U =58.0, P =0.028).
PMC4029575	A00002	Extracts of Schistosoma haematobium include estrogen-like metabolites termed catechol-estrogens that down regulate estrogen receptors alpha and beta in estrogen responsive cells.
PMC4029575	A00003	In addition, schistosome derived catechol-estrogens induce genotoxicity that result in estrogen-DNA adducts.
PMC4029575	A00004	These catechol estrogens and the catechol-estrogen-DNA adducts can be isolated from sera of people infected with S. haematobium .
PMC4029575	A00005	The aim of this study was to study infertility in females infected with S. haematobium and its association with the presence of schistosome-derived catechol-estrogens.
PMC4029575	A01002	Urine was collected from the participants for egg-based parasitological assessment of schistosome infection, and for liquid chromatography diode array detection electron spray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/UV-DAD/ESI-MSn) to investigate estrogen metabolites in the urine.
PMC4029575	A01004	The catechol-estrogens/ DNA adducts were significantly associated with schistosomiasis (OR 3.35; 95% CI 2.32–4.84; P ≤0.001).
PMC4029575	A02000	Estrogen metabolites occur widely in diverse metabolic pathways.
PMC4029575	A02001	In view of the statistically significant association between catechol-estrogens/ DNA adducts and self-reported infertility, we propose that an estrogen-DNA adduct mediated pathway in S. haematobium -induced ovarian hormonal deregulation could be involved.
PMC4029575	A02002	In addition, the catechol-estrogens/ DNA adducts described here represent potential biomarkers for schistosomiasis haematobia.
PMC4029575	D00011	In this regard, it is relevant to note that S. haematobium expresses estrogenic molecules that down regulate the expression of estrogen receptors in vitro ,  Manifestations of FGS in the young are difficult to evaluate because intra-vaginal inspection is only infrequently performed before the onset of puberty and/or sexual activity.
PMC4029575	D00015	Based on the present findings, we predict that a diagnostic method based on mass spectrometric analysis of schistosome catechol estrogens in urine of S. haematobium infected persons could provide a novel, less invasive tool to complement current approaches.
PMC4029575	D00020	The aromatase enzyme, encoded by the CYP19 gene, converts the androgens testosterone and androstenedione to estradiol and oestrone, respectively.
PMC4029575	D00021	Therefore mutation in CYP19 gene results in estrogen deficiency in both females and males .
PMC4029575	D00023	Even though our present report presents a statistical association between the presence of estrogen metabolites in the urine of S. haematobium -infected females and sub-fertility, several confounding variables may weaken our hypothesis.
PMC4029575	D00027	Given the context of the association between FGS and difficulty in becoming pregnant, the presence of putative mutagenic catechol-estrogens in S. haematobium infected persons may have practical implications for development of new approaches to control FGS and its sequelae.
PMC4029575	D00029	We now present evidence, also by mass spectrometry, of the detection and characterization of similar molecules in the urine of S. haematobium infected people, of which the majority are catechol estrogen quinones.
PMC4029575	D00030	The genotoxicity of estrogen metabolites might be attributed to oxidation of catechol-estrogens to quinones followed by redox cycling and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that in turn react with DNA , .
PMC4029575	D00033	Given that the genome and transcriptomes of eggs, female and male adult worms of S. haematobium is available , studies utilizing RNA interference and/or other functional genomic tools to silence components of estrogen catabolism pathways e.g. schistosome estradiol 17beta-dehydrogenase should be informative .
PMC4029575	M04008	Collision Induced Dissociation-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) and MSn analyses were performed using helium with collision energy of 25–35 eV. The HPLC used a LiChroCART C18 column (125 mm×4 mm; 5 µm particle diameter, end-capped) with the temperature maintained at 25 °C; the mobile phase was composed of 1% (v/v) acetic acid in water (A) and acetonitrile, which had been degassed and filtered (B).
PMC4029575	M04012	The instrument was calibrated with caffeine (Sigma-Aldrich), Met-Arg-Phe-Ala (MRFA) (tetrapeptide, Thermo Finnigan), and Ultramark 1621 (Lancaster Synthesis, Ward Hill, MA) in the mass range of 195–1,821 m/z.
PMC4029575	M04013	An advantage of inclusion of a MS detector over conventional HPLC analysis is that the number of channels in the detector can be set to specifically and separately identify all estrogen related compounds in a single injection of the urine sample.
PMC4029575	R01001	Inspection of the chromatography revealed several intense peaks, and four of these peaks corresponded to novel metabolites with catechol-estrogen-quinone radicals that, to our knowledge, have not been described previously.
PMC4029575	R01002	We analyzed the estrogen-related compounds using LC/DAD/ESI-MSn to yield the typical intensity spectra of the representative estrogen derivatives obtained by LC.
PMC4029575	R01010	Values of the RT, parent m/z, daughter m/z and the molecular mass of the four new catechols are provided in the .
PMC4029575	R02000	Comparisons between S. haematobium +ve and S. haematobium –ve participants revealed a significant association between presence of S. haematobium eggs in the urine and hematuria and presence of estrogen metabolites in urine and Group 2 (self-reported primary infertility).
PMC4029575	R02001	A significant association between self-reported infertility (Group 2+3) and S. haematobium estrogen metabolites in urine also was observed.
PMC4068805	A00006	Pathway analysis revealed networks associated with amino acid metabolism, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, phospholipids and purine metabolism in the ARDS BALF.
PMC4068805	A01000	biomarkers, critical illness, metabolomics, lung injury, bioinformatics, phospholipids, lactate, xanthine oxidase, hippurate, pharmacotherapy
PMC4068805	D00008	Of the 44 total identified compounds that were significantly different between control and ARDS groups, only one compound, L-lactate, was identified by both of the two methods.
PMC4068805	D00012	In HILIC, chloride anions and other salts are retained by the column and elute over a broad retention time range (from 6–17 minutes of the 20 minute run), thereby causing substantial ion suppression of later-eluting peaks.
PMC4068805	D00013	This may explain the somewhat atypical observation that the majority of the analytes detected by HILIC were relatively non-polar compounds such as phospholipids and free fatty acids, which elute early during the separation.
PMC4068805	D00014	On the other hand, there was a relative paucity of non-polar species such as phospholipids and free fatty acids in the RPLC separation.
PMC4068805	D00018	Despite the certain technical limitations of our analytical approach, we identified potential differentiating metabolites of ARDS as evidenced by the over four-fold increase in L-lactate and changes in other metabolites associated with energy metabolism (e.g., citrate, creatine, creatinine).
PMC4068805	D00019	Citrate, creatine and creatinine are three metabolites that were also found to be increased in ARDS plasma samples by 1D-_1 H-NMR._,  
PMC4068805	D00022	This was illustrated, as an example, by the metabolite, L-lactate.
PMC4068805	D00023	The measurement of blood lactate is often and widely used as a biomarker of the severity of critical illnesses, including sepsis.
PMC4068805	D00024	While there are multiple sources of lactate represented in the blood during critical illness and because lactate is normally detected in the blood, blood lactate is not a specific marker of lung injury and the precise range of lactate concentrations associated with overall illness severity has not been defined.
PMC4068805	D00025	_,  Like the blood, lactate levels in the lung during normal physiology are low.
PMC4068805	D00026	However, lung damage results in increased lactate production which has been shown to be inversely related to the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO_2 ):fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO_2 ) ratio which is indicative of the lung injury severity._,
PMC4068805	D00027	Despite the potential utility of BALF lactate as a marker of lung injury severity, it is unlikely that any one metabolite can serve as a prognostic biomarker of ARDS due to the complexity and heterogeneity of this disease.
PMC4068805	D00028	This complexity is illustrated by significant alterations in a number of different metabolic pathways including a reduction in phosphatidylcholines (PC), the primary phospholipid of pulmonary surfactant.
PMC4068805	D00029	The PC content of surfactant has been shown to be inversely associated with inflammatory cell-mediated lung injury in ARDS.
PMC4068805	D00030	In addition, PC is important for the maintenance of alveolar structure and function that are needed for effective gas exchange which is compromised in ARDS.
PMC4068805	D00031	As such, the reduction in PC likely reflects a lower alveolar pool of surfactant which contributes to these ARDS-induced detriments in the lungs.
PMC4068805	D00032	Other significant metabolites included guanosine, xanthine and hypoxanthine.
PMC4068805	D00034	There was a nearly four-fold increase in guanosine and 41 and 19 fold increases in hypoxantine and xanthine, respectively.
PMC4068805	D00035	Interestingly, uric acid, which is the product of guanosine metabolism has been shown to be a major “danger signal” in the lung, contributing to cell-death induced acute inflammation._,  While we did not detect uric acid, it has previously been detected in ARDS BALF and the presence of the precursor metabolites suggest that the pathway is activated.
PMC4068805	D00036	This could be of significant consequence to the lungs given that, in addition to uric acid production, xanthine oxidase (XO) is a known superoxide anion producing enzyme via its conversion of xanthine to uric acid.
PMC4068805	D00040	Collectively, these data suggest a role of the guanosine network in ARDS, which could be a potential avenue for future investigation.
PMC4068805	D00041	Another compound significantly increased in ARDS BALF, hippurate, is a known metabolite of the gut microbiome, an abundant urine metabolite, and a uremic toxin.
PMC4068805	D00042	_,  Hippurate levels are influenced by diet and the microbiome of the gut because its precursor, benzoic acid, is produced by the conversion of low molecular weight aromatic compounds and dietary polyphenols by colon microbes.
PMC4068805	D00043	Hippurate is subsequently generated by the conjugation of benzoic acid and glycine in the liver.
PMC4068805	D00044	However, recent findings from a study of patients with colectomies showed that in humans, hippurate is derived from precursors absorbed in the small intestine and its production may not be specific to the gut.
PMC4068805	D00045	The physiological consequence of elevated levels of hippurate in the lung are not known but in the kidney, in the setting of chronic kidney disease, hippurate overload accelerates renal damage and it has been shown to stimulate reactive oxygen species production in endothelial cells.
PMC4068805	D00046	Interestingly, hippurate levels in the urine have been shown to correlate with lung function in COPD patients.
PMC4068805	D00061	Parodoxically, higher levels of lidocaine were found in control samples.
PMC4068805	D00062	This is explained by the fact that healthy control subjects received more local lidocaine anesthetic as part of the lavage procedure than the already anesthetized, mechanically ventilated ARDS patients.
PMC4068805	D00063	Conversely, penicilloic acid V and propofol glucuronide, were only detected in ARDS patients and represent exogenous metabolites of penicillin antibiotics and propofol, respectively._,  
PMC4068805	M00002	A standard technique was employed in which BALF was collected by bronchoscopy in which 150 ml of normal saline was instilled into the right middle lobe or lingula in 30 ml aliquots and was retrieved by gentle suctioning through the suction port of the bronchoscope.
PMC4068805	M02000	 Water, methanol, acetonitrile, formic acid, ammonium bicarbonate, ammonium hydroxide solution, and ammonium acetate (99.999%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) and were LC-MS grade except as noted.

PMC4068805	R03008	Also present were a number of exogenous drug metabolites, arising from the administration of compounds associated with the lavage procedure (i.e., lidocaine) and the treatment of sepsis-induced ARDS (i.e., penicilloic acid V and propofol glucuronide); these compounds were excluded from the analysis.
PMC4068805	R04004	These metabolites were dominated by two classes of molecules: free fatty acids and various phosphatidylcholine species.
PMC4068805	R04005	In most cases, phosphatidylcholine species were decreased and free fatty acids were elevated in BALF from ARDS patients.
PMC4068805	R05002	This included the guanosine network of which the abundant ARDS BALF metabolites, hypoxanthine and xanthine, belong.
PMC4068805	R05003	A number of lipid metabolites including arachidonic, palmitoleic and linoleic acids, were also increased.
PMC4068805	R05004	In contrast, one of the main components of pulmonary surfactant, phosphatidylcholine, was decreased in ARDS.

PMC4101505	A00001	We conducted two exploratory independent studies in order to characterise PBMC’s metabolomic profile following short-term vitamin D3 supplementation and to determine gender effects.
PMC4101505	A00002	In the first study, eight healthy males and females aged 40–65 y were randomly selected for profiling of PBMCs after receiving either 15 µg of vitamin D3 or placebo for four weeks.
PMC4101505	A00004	Cell metabolites were extracted and deproteinised using methanol/chloroform/water method and analysed by GC-MS.
PMC4101505	A00005	Higher vitamin D status had no effect on the fatty acid profile of PBMCs, but inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines correlated positively with stearic acid levels.

PMC4101505	M00005	Several biochemical markers were measured in serum or plasma, depending on the instructions and have been reported elsewhere, including tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), ferritin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), insulin, leptin, resistin, hsC-reactive protein (hsCRP), glucose, adiponectin, TG, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) and total, LDL and HDL cholesterol.
PMC4101505	M00007	In the first study, samples were obtained post the 4-week intervention, and the placebo group was the control group not receiving vitamin D supplementation.
PMC4101505	M01002	The PBMC cell layer was then collected into a 15-mL conical tube and washed twice with sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Invitrogen, New Zealand).
PMC4101505	M01004	Cell metabolites were extracted and deproteinised using methanol/chloroform/water method.
PMC4101505	M01005	Cell pellets were resuspended in 1 mL of ice-cold methanol/chloroform mixture (2:1) and kept on ice for 2 min until 40 µL of an antioxidant, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and 300 µL of ice cold water and 300 µL of chloroform were added.
PMC4101505	M01007	The lipid extracts were dried under nitrogen, and methyl esters were derivatised immediately after extraction.
PMC4101505	M01009	Briefly, to the dry lipid extract, 1 mL of methanol, 1 mL of BF3 methanol and 40 µL of BHT were added.
PMC4101505	M01010	Heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) was used as an internal standard, and 20 µL of the C17:0 (2 mg/mL in methanol) was also added.
PMC4101505	M01011	The samples were boiled for 20 min and methyl esters were extracted by the addition of 2 mL hexane and 2 mL deionised water.
PMC4101505	M01013	The supernatant was dried under nitrogen and dissolved in 200 µL of hexane for gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis.
PMC4101505	M01015	The dried sample was resuspended in 200 µL of water, and 20 µL of the internal standard, _13 C myristic acid (1 mg/mL in methanol), were added.
PMC4101505	M01018	The samples were dissolved in 210 µL of hexane for GC-MS analysis.
PMC4101505	M02008	Fatty Acid Methyl Esters (FAME) 37 compound mix (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) and amino acids (AA) standard (Sigma Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) were used as known standards for FA and AA, respectively.
PMC4101505	R00000	PBMC samples from subjects (N = 8) receiving a vitamin D supplement or a placebo were isolated and the FA profiled.
PMC4101505	R00006	There were no significant differences in the metabolic health and inflammatory parameters measured Biochemical markers of subjects in the vitamin D3 supplemented and placebo groups (Study 1).

PMC4101505	R00012	* Unadjusted p -value; values are means and SD; multivariate GLM was used to compare FA PBMC levels between the vitamin D supplemented and placebo groups.
PMC4101505	R01001	There was a strong positive association between C18:0 and hsCRP, IL-6 and adiponectin.
PMC4101505	R01002	A significant positive correlation was also observed between total SFA and CRP and adiponectin, C24:0 and leptin, C20:0 and resistin, Negative correlations were observed between C16:0 and total cholesterol, C18:2n6 and adiponectin, C20:3n6 and resistin, C20:0 and 25(OH)D.
PMC4101505	R02005	After controlling for BMI, there was a significant difference observed for C16:0 (p = 0.025), C18:1n9c (p = 0.018) and total MUFA (p = 0.015) between males and females.
PMC4101505	R02008	In the unadjusted model, the percentage of isoleucine (p = 0.003) was significantly higher in males vs . females.
PMC4101505	R02009	Aspartic acid was lower in the PBMC from males (p = 0.02).
PMC4101505	R02017	In subsequent analysis by BMI groups (low vs . high), valine (2.1 ± 0.5 vs .
PMC4101505	R02018	3.1 ± 0.7%, p = 0.02) and isoleucine (2.1 ± 0.4 vs .
PMC4101505	R02019	2.7 ± 0.4%, p = 0.011) were lower, and aspartic acid (11.3 ± 2.3 vs .
PMC4101505	R03005	In the present study, there were no differences in the FA profile of PBMCs in the vitamin D supplemented group compared to a placebo group.
PMC4101505	R03009	As expected, the most abundant was arachidonic acid (20:4n6), a main energy source for activated immunologic cells that plays an important role in the control of cellular metabolism during inflammation [,].
PMC4101505	R03010	Since the discovery of VDR in macrophages, dendritic cells and activated T and B lymphocytes, vitamin D has been suggested to play a role in modulating immune response.
PMC4101505	R03012	The vitamin D group successfully increased their vitamin D status after four weeks of vitamin D3 supplementation, as compared to the control group not receiving vitamin D.
PMC4101505	R03015	Two inflammatory markers, hsCRP and IL-6, had a strong positive association with stearic acid (C18:0), but not palmitic acid (C16:0).
PMC4101505	R03016	Generally, exposure to palmitic acid is associated with its proinflammatory effect on variety of cells [,].
PMC4101505	R03017	It has also been previously reported that C18:0 from PBMC phospholipids was negatively correlated with IL-6 production after inflammatory stimulus.
PMC4101505	R03021	Adiponectin, in contrast, regarded as an anti-inflammatory adipokine that is generally reduced in obesity, was also positively related to the C18:0 and SFA of PBMC.
PMC4101505	R03023	Nevertheless, since we did not observe in this study any differences in serum inflammatory markers, as well as the arachidonic acid content of PBMC, we cannot extrapolate the above findings to inflammatory functions following increased vitamin D intake.
PMC4101505	R03024	The release of arachidonic acid followed by the eicosanoid production pathway is the main characteristic of inflammation processes.
PMC4101505	R03027	However, after controlling for multiple comparisons, only isoleucine significantly differed between genders.
PMC4101505	R03031	While glutamine plays a major role in the metabolism of immune system cells, other AAs have important regulatory functions by affecting protein synthesis, the production of cytokines and other immune functions.
PMC4101505	R03032	Aspartic acid plays an important role in the production of NO through ciruline recycling and is crucial for cell proliferation in response to immunological challenges.
PMC4101505	R03033	Branched Chain Amino acids (BCAAs), including valine and isoleucine, are the essential AA involved in protein synthesis through their action on the mTOR signalling pathway and were found in the second study to be higher in the PBMCs of persons with higher BMI or confounded by BMI in the between genders comparison.
PMC4102553	A00000	Prednisone is often used for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases but they suffer from variable therapeutic responses and significant adverse effects.
PMC4102553	A00003	The patients with myasthenia gravis are primarily treated with prednisone.
PMC4102553	A00004	We analyzed the metabolomic profile of serum collected from patients prior to and after 12 weeks of prednisone treatment during a clinical trial.
PMC4102553	A00008	Chronic prednisone treatment caused upregulation of membrane associated glycerophospholipids: phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, 1, 2-diacyl-sn glycerol 3 phosphate and 1-Acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine.
PMC4102553	A00009	Arachidonic acid (AA) and AA derived pro-inflammatory eicosanoids such as 18-carboxy dinor leukotriene B4 and 15 hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids were reduced.
PMC4102553	A00011	Chronic prednisone treatment caused increase in membrane associated glycerophospholipids, which may be associated with certain adverse effects.
PMC4102553	A00012	Decrease of AA and AA derived pro-inflammatory eicosanoids demonstrate that immunosuppression by corticosteroid is via suppression of pro-inflammatory pathways.
PMC4102553	A00013	The study identified metabolomic fingerprints that can now be validated as prednisone responsive biomarkers for the improvement in diagnostic accuracy and prediction of therapeutic outcome.
PMC4102553	D00000	Untargeted metabolic profiling of serum obtained from patients before and after 12 weeks of prednisone treatment demonstrated an unambiguous metabolic signature of chronic glucocorticoid treatment.
PMC4102553	D00005	The OPLS-DA score plots clearly showed inter-group segregation of samples from subjects who were prednisone-naïve and after 12 weeks of prednisone therapy.
PMC4102553	D00006	Assessment of fold changes identified metabolites with a significant fold change (p<0.05) with prednisone treatment demonstrated overall consistency with expected biological variability across subjects; however, outliers existed with significantly greater fold changes.
PMC4102553	D00007	Taken together the observations support a uniform metabolomic signature for chronic prednisone treatment.
PMC4102553	D00008	Detailed analysis of the differentially regulated metabolites revealed a significant change in glycerophospholipid metabolism.
PMC4102553	D00009	Out of the top 50 discriminating features identified by RF and represented in the heat maps, the majority were glycerophospholipids signifying a strong impact of prednisone treatment on glycerophospholipid metabolism.
PMC4102553	D00010	Corticosteroid stimulated de novo synthesis of PC was observed in developing lung and was associated with an increase in choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase activity .
PMC4102553	D00011	Metabolomic analyses of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from dexamethasone treated, experimentally induced asthma mouse model identified a similar increase in PC level associated with a decrease in choline level .
PMC4102553	D00012	We found an increase in PC level and a decrease in intermediate phosphocholine level.
PMC4102553	D00014	The synthesis of PC can occur through two pathways; CDP-choline pathway and PE methylation pathway .
PMC4102553	D00015	The free choline that is incorporated into PC is recycled back to the pool through hydrolysis by the enzyme phospholipase D .
PMC4102553	D00016	There is an overall increase in PC, PE, PS and the intermediate DAG signifying that the entire PE-methylation pathway is up regulated in response to prednisone treatment.
PMC4102553	D00017	Apart from the increase in glycerophospholipid synthesis, a significant decrease in AA and AA acid mediated pro-inflammatory metabolites was observed.
PMC4102553	D00018	Biologically active lipids derived from AA have crucial roles in inflammation.
PMC4102553	D00019	Enzymatic oxidation of AA is mediated by cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX) and P450 epoxygenase pathways generating eicosanoids.
PMC4102553	D00020	COX enzymes metabolize AA to pro-inflammatory prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes (TXs).
PMC4102553	D00021	LOX mediated pathway converts AA to leukotrienes (LTs), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and lipoxins.
PMC4102553	D00022	Cytochrome P450 metabolizes AA to cell signaling molecules such as epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, HETEs and hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids .
PMC4102553	D00023	We found a downregulation of AA and downstream eicosanoids of COX and LOX pathways.
PMC4102553	D00024	Glucocorticoid inhibits prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting translation of PG synthase enzyme .
PMC4102553	D00025	AA release by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is suppressed by glucocorticoids causing downregulation of prostaglandin and leukotriene synthesis .
PMC4102553	D00027	These alterations were identified by serum metabolite analysis and have the potential for being monitored to assess prednisone associated alterations.
PMC4102553	D00028	Vitamin E succinate, which has anti-inflammatory properties, was increased .
PMC4102553	D00029	3-Deoxyvitamin D3, an anti-inflammatory metabolite, was reduced .
PMC4102553	D00030	One action of glucocorticoids is to subvert metabolic pathways away from pro-inflammatory AA synthesis, towards anti-inflammatory endocannabinoid synthesis pathway .
PMC4102553	D00031	Though there was an increase in phospholipids in response to prednisone treatment, a decrease in AA and AA derived eicosanoids was found.
PMC4102553	D00032	Endocannabinoids are local lipid messengers that induce immune- and neuro-protection through the activation of G-protein coupled cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2 .
PMC4102553	D00033	Endocannabinoid pathway metabolites were not identified in the metabolomic screening, but given their rapid and transient production the present analysis cannot rule out their modulation by chronic steroid treatment.
PMC4102553	D00036	However, reduction in serum levels of L-phenylalanine, O-acetylserine and N2-acetyl-L-ornithine was found indicating an imbalance in protein synthesis and degradation .
PMC4102553	D00037	A decrease in aconitate ion and 3-epihydroxy-2′-deoxymugineic acid shows deregulation of energy metabolism.
PMC4102553	D00038	Although perturbation in citric acid cycle was noted, we expected a greater number of metabolic pathways to be effected by prednisone treatment.
PMC4102553	D00042	For example, a 6 fold increase in hydroxyspheroidenone, involved in carotenoid biosynthesis was found that is not known to be related to steroid treatment or myasthenia gravis.
PMC4102553	D00046	From our study we can clearly see a trend of suppression of anti-inflammatory pathways by prednisone treatment and an increase in membrane phospholipid synthesis.
PMC4102553	D00047	Altered PC metabolism has been suggested in asthma with increase in level of PC and decrease in level of lyso-PC and Crohn’s disease where phospholipids were increased .
PMC4102553	D00048	Differences in free choline and PC level in serum have been associated with early markers of risk of having cardiovascular disease (CVD) .
PMC4102553	D00049	Our results suggest AA could be used to assess treatment response and we hypothesize that PC levels may correlated to tissue complication of steroid treatment.
PMC4102553	D00050	No previous investigation has evaluated metabolomic modifications among humans with an autoimmune disorder treatment with chronic prednisone administration.
PMC4102553	D00051	Despite the powerful effects on human physiology of prednisone, we identified metabolic alterations to be limited primarily to glycerophospholipid and arachidonic acid pathway alterations.
PMC4102553	M01000	All samples were obtained during the course of a clinical trial performed by the Muscle Study Group (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00683969) and drawn as part of routine phlebotomy to evaluate acetylcholine receptor antibody levels at study initiation and after 12 weeks of prednisone treatment.
PMC4102553	M01003	The subjects had mild to moderate MG with serum antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor antibodies.
PMC4102553	M01005	For this study we used 15 serum samples of the patients obtained at trial initiation prior to treatment and then at 12 weeks of treatment with prednisone.
PMC4102553	M02002	For metabolite extraction, 175 µL of 66% acetonitrile (in water) containing internal standards [10 µL of debrisoquine (1 mg/mL) and 50 µL of 4, nitro-benzoic acid (1 mg/mL)] were added to 25 µL of serum.
PMC4102553	M03001	The gradient mobile phase comprised of water containing 0.1% formic acid solution (A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid solution (B).
PMC4102553	M03011	Accurate mass was maintained by infusing sulfadimethoxine (311.0814 m/z ) in 50% aqueous acetonitrile (250 pg/µL) at a rate of 30 µL/min via the lockspray interface every 10 seconds.
PMC4102553	M03016	For untargeted metabolomics profiling, the extraction buffer was spiked with a known concentration of internal standards (4, nitrobenzoic acid in negative mode and debrisoquine in positive mode) to account for variability in the extraction procedure and for inconsistencies during the MS acquisition.
PMC4102553	M04000	Centroided and integrated UPLC-TOFMS data were pre-processed using the XCMS software and normalized to the ion intensity of respective internal standards (4, nitrobenzoic acid in the negative mode and debrisoquine in the positive mode).
PMC4102553	R00030	Metabolomic profiling of serum samples showed statistically significant changes in glycerophospholipid metabolism (p≤0.05), in response to prednisone treatment.
PMC4102553	R00031	Within the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, phosphatidylcholine (PC) (4 to 11 fold; p = 6.89E-06), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (2 to 12 fold; p = 3.23E-08), phosphatidylserine (PS) (2 to 10 fold; p = 3.73E-08), 1,2-diacyl-sn glycerol 3 phosphate (phosphatidate, LPA) (2.12 fold; p = 3.27E-03), and 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Lyso PC) (1.73 to 6.25 fold; p = 3.94E-3) showed increase in expression (; ).
PMC4102553	R00032	Phosphocholine demonstrated a decrease of 0.87 fold (p = 2.40E-02).
PMC4102553	R00033	The figure represents glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway from KEGG resource showing the metabolites that change significantly in MG patients after prednisone treatment.
PMC4102553	R00036	Arachidonic acid metabolism and related anti-inflammatory pathway was found to be downregulated by prednisone treatment ( and , ).
PMC4102553	R00037	Downregulation of AA (0.42 fold; p = 4.46E-04), 18-carboxy dinor leukotriene B4 (0.77 fold; p = 2.5E-04) and 15 hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (15HETE) (0.34 fold; p = 1.01E-03) was observed.
PMC4102553	R00038	We have identified a metabolite with m/z value 369.2254 in negative ionization mode which corresponds with thromboxane B2 and 6-Keto prostaglandin F1alpha.
PMC4102553	R00039	Determining the exact identity of the metabolite was beyond the scope of the study but both the putative metabolites are present downstream of cox1/cox2 pathway of prostaglandin G2 metabolism.
PMC4102553	R00041	The figure represents arachidonic acid metabolism pathway from KEGG resource showing the metabolites that are downregulated in MG patients in response to prednisone treatment.
PMC4102553	R00045	Membrane glycerophospholipids are upregulated in response to prednisone treatment.
PMC4102553	R00046	Arachidonic Acid (AA) metabolism via cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) pathway is downregulated causing reduction of pro-inflammatory metabolites.

Other metabolites that showed statistically significant alterations in expression were L-phenylalanine (0.66 fold; p = 7.63E-04), O-acetylserine (0.55 fold, p = 1.45E-02) and N2-acetyl-L-ornithine (0.72 fold; p = 1.24E-02); involved in amino acid metabolism.
PMC4102553	R00048	Citric acid cycle demonstrated perturbation, as noted by decrease in aconitate ion (0.731; p = 6.43E-6) and 3-epihydroxy-2′-deoxymugineic acid (0.67 fold; p = 3.78E-03).
PMC4102553	R00049	Vitamin E succinate (1.41 fold; p = 1.39E-02) showed an increase and 3-deoxyvitamin D3 (0.49 fold; p = 1.86E-05) showed a decrease in abundance in the post-treatment group.
PMC4102553	R00050	Hydroxyspheroidenone, involved in carotenoid biosynthesis, was increased by 6.27 fold (p = 7.25E-08).
PMC4102553	R01000	Validation of PC, PE and AA was done by UPLC-TOFMS/MS by comparing the fragmentation pattern of the standards with the ones present in the samples.
PMC4102553	R01001	We matched the parent and the daughter ions and confirmed the presence of PC (m/z 184.07, 185.07, 786.59, 787.60, 788.60), PE (m/z 184.07, 185.07, 772.58) and AA (m/z 259.24, 303.23) in our samples.
PMC4150403	A00010	15 metabolites were identified such as pyridoxine, orotidine, and taurocholic acid.
PMC4150403	A00011	Main metabolic cycles involved were the bile acid biosynthesis, vitamin B6 metabolism, methane metabolism, and glutathione metabolism.
PMC4150403	A00014	Our observations corroborated earlier studies that suggest the importance of lowering serum LCA/DCA and increasing vitamin B6 intake to help prevent colon cancer.
PMC4150403	D00001	Of all the cycles involved, primary bile acid biosynthesis and degradation of ketone bodies and cyanoamino acid metabolism were the major ones.
PMC4150403	D00002	Of all the metabolites involved, the main ones were cholesterol, glycine, glycocholic acid, and taurocholic acid which are involved in primary bile acid biosynthesis.
PMC4150403	D00004	Reports show the presence of higher deoxycholic acids in serum and bile of the patients with colonic adenomas than in the healthy controls.
PMC4150403	D00007	Reduction of LCA/DCA is reported on experiments carried out on rats fed on a high diet supplemented with vitamin B6.
PMC4150403	D00008	The second metabolic cycle involved in colon cancer is vitamin B6.
PMC4150403	D00010	It upregulates a protective factor, insulin like growth factor binding protein 1 (IGFBP1); its mRNA is upregulated in HT29 colon carcinoma cells exposed to pyridoxal (a form of vitamin B6).
PMC4150403	D00012	ELISA indicated analysis showed that supplemental vitamin B6 significantly lowered levels of colonic HSP70, heme-oxygenase-1, and HSP32 which increase cell proliferation and colonic damage.
PMC4150403	D00014	In mice receiving the colonic carcinogen azoxymethane, the development of colonic aberrant crypt foci, precursor lesions of colon cancer, and cell proliferation are suppressed by vitamin B6 supplementation.
PMC4150403	D00015	The next effective cycle is the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies with 3-hydroxybutyric acid as the metabolite involved.
PMC4150403	D00017	This is attributed to the fact that most malignant cells depend on glucose as fuel and cannot metabolize fatty acids easily due to dysfunction of the mitochondria.
PMC4150403	D00018	Malignant cells grown in vitro are negatively affected by low glucose and a similar antitumorigenic property of low carbohydrate diets is shown in mice in vivo experiments.
PMC4150403	D00019	3-Hydroxybutyric acid is also a biomarker detected by GC-MS from sera of colorectal patients.
PMC4150403	D00020	Glycine is a very important metabolite as it takes part in the next four cycles of cyanoamino metabolism, thiamine metabolism, methane metabolism, and glutathione metabolism.
PMC4150403	D00021	Association between increase in serum glycine and colon cancer has been shown in many studies.
PMC4150403	D00022	Glycine is differentiating metabolites for colon cancer as seen in metabolomic studies by time of flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS).
PMC4150403	D00023	An in vitro study carried out on cancer cells by metabolite profiling indicates key role of glycine in cancer cell proliferation.
PMC4150403	D00024	Thiamine or vitamin B1 has an important role in cancer cells as shown by investigations using the thiamine-degrading enzyme, thiaminase.
PMC4150403	D00025	Liu et al. showed that the addition of thiaminase into cell culture media containing thiamine had a significant inhibitory effect on growth of breast cancer cells.
PMC4150403	D00026	Also a pegylated version of thiaminase was capable in delaying tumor growth and prolonging survival in an RS4 leukemia xenograft model [, ] and it is seen that the increased glycine and thiamine are linked.
PMC4150403	D00027	Methane metabolism by bacteria in the large intestine has been reported as early as 1977.
PMC4150403	D00028	This report showed that excretion of methane in breath occurred twice as frequent in patients with colonic cancer as normal individuals.
PMC4150403	D00030	The glutathione pathway is seen after increasing glycine.
PMC4150403	D00031	Glutathione levels in primary colorectal cancer tissues were significantly higher than in the corresponding normal tissues.
PMC4150403	D00032	Reports show that elevated glutathione levels had a significant negative effect on survival rate in patients with colorectal cancer.
PMC4150403	D00034	Glycine also is seen to participate in glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism which increases in colon cancer and is part of nitrogen metabolism.
PMC4150403	D00035	(R)-3-Hydroxybutyric acid is very important in butanoate metabolism.
PMC4150403	D00036	The antitumor effects of butyrate were described in studies using colorectal cancer cell lines in which butyrate inhibits growth and induces differentiation and apoptosis.
PMC4150403	D00037	In other studies butyrate was able to inhibit tumor growth in vivo in murine models.
PMC4150403	D00038	But there are conflicting reports about the protective role of butyrate as seen that colorectal cells still increase and grow even though there are high concentrations of butyrate in the colon.
PMC4150403	D00039	Fucose and mannose metabolism are affected by L-fucose which is an important posttranslational modification in cancer and inflammation.
PMC4150403	M01000	600 μ L of serum with 70 μ L D_2 O and 1 mM sodium 2-trimethylsilylpropionate (TMSP) was used as internal reference in a 5 mm NMR tube at room temperature and data acquisition was carried out.
PMC4198189	A00000	Homocysteinylation of lysine residues by homocysteine thiolactone (HCTL), a reactive homocysteine metabolite, results in protein aggregation and malfunction, and is a well-known risk factor for cardiovascular, autoimmune and neurological diseases.
PMC4198189	A00001	Human plasma paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and bleomycin hydrolase (Blmh) have been reported as the physiological HCTL detoxifying enzymes.
PMC4198189	A00002	However, the catalytic efficiency of HCTL hydrolysis by Blmh is low and not saturated at 20 mM HCTL.
PMC4198189	A00003	The catalytic efficiency of PON1 for HCTL hydrolysis is 100-fold lower than that of Blmh.
PMC4198189	A00004	A homocysteine thiolactonase (HCTLase) was purified from human liver and identified by mass spectrometry (MS) as the previously described human biphenyl hydrolase-like protein (BPHL).
PMC4198189	A00006	The sequence of the recombinant BPHL (rBPHL) and hydrolytic products of the substrates HCTL and valacyclovir were verified by MS.
PMC4198189	A00007	We found that the catalytic efficiency (k_cat /K_m ) of rBPHL for HCTL hydrolysis was 7.7 × 10_4 M_−1 s_−1 , orders of magnitude higher than that of PON1 or Blmh, indicating a more significant physiological role for BPHL in detoxifying HCTL.
PMC4198189	D00005	This report describes the characterization of the highly efficient HCTLase activity of BPHL, a protein previously known only for its role in drug metabolism , and provides a more complete understanding of the detoxication pathways for HCTL.
PMC4198189	D00006	One risk associated with elevated levels of plasma Hcy is related to the formation of disulfide bonds with free cysteine residues on proteins.
PMC4198189	D00007	For example, disulfide bond derivatization of annexin A2 complex by Hcy prevents tissue plasminogen activator binding to A2, resulting in decreased fibrinolytic activity and inhibition of angiogenesis .
PMC4198189	D00008	A second mechanism of protein modification involves the covalent addition of Hcy to the ε-amino groups of lysine residues by HCTL, which can cause protein misfolding, aggregation, loss of function and generation of autoimmune responses , .
PMC4198189	D00009	A number of experiments have examined the question of whether Hcy or HCTL is the more toxic species.
PMC4198189	D00010	Studies with yeast strains with mutations in yeast Blmh demonstrated increased sensitivity to HCTL and studies with mice also demonstrated increased sensitivity to HCTL .
PMC4198189	D00011	Thus, detoxication of HCTL is an important component in understanding the relationship of hyperhomocysteinemia to vascular and other diseases.
PMC4198189	D00013	However, the data reported here strongly suggest that the previously unrecognized HCTLase activity of BPHL is likely to be physiologically more relevant than either PON1 or Blmh for hydrolyzing HCTL and reducing the risk of vascular and other HCTL-associated diseases.
PMC4198189	D00014	In this regard, it is informative to compare the total HCTL detoxication capacity of plasma PON1 (K_m , 23 mM) with that of liver HCTLase (K_m , 3.18 mM).
PMC4198189	D00015	Since many of the HCTLase activities reported for plasma PON1 were carried out with labeled 1 mM HCTL, it makes sense to compare activities at this concentration of substrate.
PMC4198189	D00016	Rates for lower HCTL concentrations are easily extrapolated since 1 mM is below the K_m value for both proteins.
PMC4198189	D00018	Assuming an average individual has ≈3 L of plasma with ≈0.0057 µmol HCTL hydrolyzed/min/mL plasma (at 1 mM HCTL) the HCTL detoxication capacity for plasma PON1 of an individual would be ≈17.1 µmol/min/individual.
PMC4198189	D00019	Based on the data from , 33 g of human liver yielded 118.3 Units of HCTLase (measured at 3 mM HCTL; Units  =  µmol hydrolyzed/min), which would equate to ≈1.195 U/g liver tissue at 1 mM HCTL.
PMC4198189	D00022	It is also useful to compare the catalytic efficiencies of HCTL hydrolysis by Blmh (1 × 10_3 M_−1 s_−1 ) and PON1 with that of BPHL (7.7 × 10_4 M_−1 s_−1 ) (this study).
PMC4198189	D00023	Zimny and coworkers reported that the catalytic efficiency of HCTL hydrolysis by Blmh was ≈100-fold higher than that of PON1 indicating that the catalytic efficiency of HCTL hydrolysis by BPHL is almost four orders of magnitude higher than that of PON1 and nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of Blmh.
PMC4198189	D00030	This study began with the aim of identifying the thiolactonase activity responsible for the second metabolic step in the bioactivation of the platelet inhibitor clopidogrel to the active exo-thiol since it was clear that PON1 was not the physiologically relevant activity for this second step of bioactivation , .
PMC4198189	D00032	PON1 generates an endo-thiol from clopidogrel thiolactone that is not a pharmacologically active metabolite.
PMC4198189	D00033	In the search for a liver thiolactonase that would hydrolyze the intermediate thiolactone metabolite of clopidogrel, we chose HCTL as a convenient thiolactonase substrate.
PMC4198189	D00040	The rBPHL did not detectably hydrolyze the thiolactone metabolites of the drugs clopidogrel or prasugrel (another platelet inhibitor).
PMC4198189	D00041	It is also interesting to compare the substrate specificities of the three identified HCTL hydrolases.
PMC4198189	D00042	Since BPHL metabolized the thiolactone HCTL, we tested it with several other PON1 substrates.
PMC4198189	D00043	The rBPHL failed to hydrolyze dihydrocoumarin, 2-coumaranone, phenyl acetate and DL-N -acetyl homocysteine thiolactone.
PMC4198189	D00044	GTBL is often used as a surrogate for measuring HCTL hydrolysis; however, BPHL does not hydrolyze GTBL.
PMC4198189	D00045	Many investigators cite problems of albumin interference with the Ellman assay and degradation of HCTL at alkaline pH as a rationale for using GTBL, which has been used as a lactonase substrate for analysis of PON1 activity , , , , .
PMC4198189	D00048	Blmh, an aminopeptidase, also catalyzes the hydrolysis of HCTL but not the hydrolysis of GTBL.
PMC4198189	D00050	BPHL had almost no activity for any of these substrates except for p -nitrophenyl butyrate, for which it had only low activity.
PMC4198189	D00053	It is worth noting the structural similarities between HCTL and VC as both possess a free amino group on the carbon alpha to the carbonyl that is neutralized by the enzyme's active site residue D123.
PMC4198189	D00056	The discovery of BPHL's role in converting the prodrug VC to acyclovir identified one such pathway .
PMC4198189	D00059	Since proteins did not evolve to metabolize drugs, the high HCTLase activity of BPHL reported here provides evidence that BPHL is most likely a primary detoxication pathway for HCTL and its high degree of sequence conservation across species would indicate that this HCTLase activity of BPHL is a universally shared function.
PMC4198189	M00001	A fresh solution of 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (10.3 mM) was prepared in 100 mM NaPO_4 , pH 7.0, and was added at a final concentration of 0.32 mM to a solution of 3 mM L-HCTL, in Dulbecco's PBS, with the volume dependent on the number of assays to be carried out.
PMC4198189	M00009	Activities are expressed in Units/mL or Units/mg protein, based on the molar extinction coefficient of 14.15 mmol/L_−1 cm_−1 for the hydrolysis of DTNB to 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoic acid (NTB) .
PMC4198189	M00011	Clopidogrel thiolactone, prasugrel thiolactone and the exo-thiol metabolites were a generous gift of Eli Lilly.
PMC4198189	M01000	To examine the basis of reported albumin interference of the Ellman assay , we monitored the rate of appearance of NTB in the absence of added substrate.
PMC4198189	M01001	Both purified and recombinant serum albumin exhibited a rate of appearance of NTB, characteristic of the enzymatic hydrolysis of thiolactones and thio-esters.
PMC4198189	M01003	The assay of albumin with DTNB alone has apparent activity similar to that observed with PON1 in the presence of HCTL, so controls must be performed when using DTNB and serum or plasma samples to correct for the “albumin interference”.
PMC4198189	M01004	A concentration of 10 mM EDTA did not affect the rates of the DTNB/serum assay.

PMC4198189	R02000	To determine whether liver BPHL is more important in detoxifying HCTL than Blmh or PON1, we incubated human liver homogenates with specific inhibitors for BPHL, Blmh and PON1 and assayed the residual HCTLase activity.
PMC4198189	R02002	The BPHL specific inhibitors valacyclovir and L-proline benzyl ester decreased human liver HCTLase activity by 74% and 88%, respectively.
PMC4198189	R02003	In contrast, Blmh specific inhibitor E-64, a cysteine protease inhibitor, and the two PON1 specific inhibitors EDTA and 2-hydroxyquinoline did not decrease human liver HCTLase activity.
PMC4198189	R02004	Interestingly, iodoacetamide, a reported Blmh inhibitor , decreased human liver HCTL hydrolysis by ∼50%.
PMC4198189	R04001	The K_m value for HCTL is 3.18 mM, with a V _max of 454 µmol/min/mg, a turnover number of 246.24 s_−1 (k_cat ) and a catalytic efficiency of 7.7 × 10_4 M_−1 s_−1 (k_cat /K_m ).

PMC4198189	R04010	The inset shows the daughter ion spectrum (for m/z 226) of the product peak at Rt  =  6.1 min, and is consistent with the spectrum obtained from commercial acyclovir.
PMC4198189	R04011	The small product peak at t  =  0 in chromatogram D reflects the extremely rapid metabolism of VC by rBPHL, which generated a detectable amount of acyclovir in even the very short period of time (∼10 sec) between initiation and quenching of the enzymatic reaction.
PMC4198189	R04013	In addition, EDTA, which irreversibly inhibits human PON1, had no effect on BPHL activity at a concentration of 10 mM. Other BPHL substrates, VC and L-proline benzyl ester, the latter reported to be the best substrate for human valacyclovirase , inhibited the HCTLase activity of BPHL.
PMC4198189	R04014	Since rBPHL has thiolactonase activity, other PON1 lactone substrates were tested as substrates for rBPHL.

PMC4363527	A00009	Additionally, an age-related increase in plasma L-octanoylcarnitine, lactosylceramide, SBP, and baseline BMI are independent predictors of increased arterial stiffness in middle-aged individuals.
PMC4363527	D00001	Additionally, changes in L-octanoylcarnitine, a physiologically active form of octanoylcarnitine, and lactosylceramide emerged as independent predictors of ba-PWV change, as did baseline BMI and changes in SBP.
PMC4363527	D00002	Moreover, mean changes in both ba-PWV and SBP, markers of arterial stiffness, positively correlated with changes in L-octanoylcarnitine and lactosylceramide.
PMC4363527	D00003	This finding suggests that the duration of overweight is an important risk factor for increased arterial stiffness, especially during middle age, and that this increase in arterial stiffness might be associated with age-related increases in plasma L-octanoylcarnitine and lactosylceramide.
PMC4363527	D00004	In addition to the increase in ba-PWV, the overweight subjects showed a 34% increase in L-octanoylcarnitine regardless of sex or menopause status, and a 27% increase in decanoylcarnitine over the 3-year period, whereas no significant changes occurred in normal weight subjects.
PMC4363527	D00005	Acylcarnitines are carnitine esters derived from fatty acids or amino acids that are transferred into the mitochondria.
PMC4363527	D00006	Elevated acylcarnitine production can occur when β-oxidation rates are in excess of complete oxidation to carbon dioxide through the tricarboxylic acid cycle.
PMC4363527	D00007	Thus, medium-chain acylcarnitines including octanoylcarnitine and decanoylcarnitine are known to be intermediate fatty acid β-oxidation byproducts and markers for incomplete fatty acid oxidation.
PMC4363527	D00010	Recently demonstrated elevations in acylcarnitine and amino acid concentrations in obese compared with lean [,].
PMC4363527	D00011	Chronic overfeeding leads to increased adiposity, hyperlipidemia, and ectopic accumulation of triglyceride and other lipid-derived metabolites in tissues such as liver, pancreas, skeletal muscle, and heart [,].
PMC4363527	D00012	Seiler et al. found that muscle levels of medium chain acyl-CoAs, along with several even chain acylcarnitine intermediates of fat oxidation, were elevated in rodent models of obesity.
PMC4363527	D00013	Therefore, the increase in octanoylcarnitine and decanoylcarnitine in the middle-aged overweight subjects of this study could be related to upregulated β-oxidation of fatty acids, possibly due to a higher load of FFA or higher abdominal fat accumulation [,].
PMC4363527	D00014	The changes in octanoylcarnitine and decanoylcarnitine in the present study appeared to be closely associated with changes in fasting FFA and WHR.
PMC4363527	D00016	However, acylcarnitine concentrations increase in the plasma of lean, insulinsensitive subjects during long-term fasting and relatively healthy overweight subjects during caloric restriction.
PMC4363527	D00017	These observations suggest that the acylcarnitine increase in obesity may not only be due to an impairment of metabolism but also be a natural response to an excess supply of lipid.
PMC4363527	D00018	Thus, increased production of acylcarnitine could result from excess fatty acid flux emanating from lipid stored either intracellularly or peripherally.
PMC4363527	D00019	Indeed, plasma acylcarnitine concentrations are reduced during an oral glucose tolerance test and during a euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp, both procedures that reduce plasma FFA concentrations significantly [,].
PMC4363527	D00020	Yet, under these conditions, obese and diabetic subjects maintained higher acylcarnitine concentrations than lean controls.
PMC4363527	D00021	As a result of a growing body of data in the literature, acylcarnitine levels, additionally, are proposed as biomarkers in subjects with insulin resistance [,].
PMC4363527	D00022	Indeed, acylcarnitine concentrations are higher in the fasting state in insulin-resistant populations and decrease less during glucose challenge tests [,].
PMC4363527	D00024	In present study, HOMA-IR, L-octanoylcarnitine, and decanoylcarnitine were increased in overweight group after 3-year follow-up, which are coincide with previous studies.
PMC4363527	D00028	In this study, the overweight subjects showed a significant increase of 3.42 cm in waist circumference over the 3-year period and higher plasma leucine/isoleucine levels compared with normal weight individuals at the 3-year follow-up.
PMC4363527	D00032	In the cross-sectional analysis of ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities), arteries appear to become stiffer at increasing concentrations of fasting glucose and insulin, independent of race or gender.
PMC4363527	D00034	Increased BCAAs may increase activation of mTOR/S6K1 kinase pathway, which phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), with a subsequent decline in IRS-1 associated phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity.
PMC4363527	D00035	Reduced PI 3-kinase activity may result in diminished glucose uptake and glucose utilization.
PMC4363527	D00036	Decreased glucose transport is sensed at the pancreatic β-cells, and may result in a compensatory increase in insulin secretion.
PMC4363527	D00038	Indeed, the strongly positive correlations among valine, leucine, and HOMA-IR in this study are consistent with previous findings.
PMC4363527	D00039	Thus, the greater increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglyceride, and HOMA-IR index in the overweight group compared with normal weight subjects could support the previous report of a close association between systemic BCAAs and an insulin resistance phenotype, and a subsequent arterial stiffness.
PMC4363527	D00042	Additionally, age-related increases in plasma palmitic amide and lactosylceramide were also observed in overweight subjects.
PMC4363527	D00043	Lactosylceramide, one of the ubiquitous glycosphingolipids, is generated in endothelial cells after treatment with vascular endothelial growth factor, which has been implicated in vascular pathologies.
PMC4363527	D00044	Similarly, a change in lactosylceramide was one of the independent predictors of ba-PWV change in this study.
PMC4363527	D00045	In addition, the negative association between lactosylceramide and PC (18:0/20:4) in the current study supports previous findings that lactosylceramide stimulates the activity of cytosolic Ca_2+ -dependent PLA_2 , of which the preferred substrates are phospholipids containing arachidonic acid (20:4 ω6) at the sn -2 site.
PMC4363527	D00046	Adipose tissue affects to metabolism by releasing non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol, hormones including leptin and adiponectin, and proinflammatory cytokines.
PMC4363527	D00049	In the present study, the overweight group showed glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and hs-CRP than control group, indicating insulin resistance and increased inflammatory status than controls.
PMC4363527	D00054	Despite this limitation, our approach using UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS-based metabolomics and multivariate data analysis showed greater increases in L-octanoylcarnitine and decanoylcarnitine in the overweight group compared with the control group.
PMC4363527	D00055	Additionally, the overweight group exhibited increases in L-leucine, lacosylceramide, and ba-PWV over a 3-year period.
PMC4363527	D00056	Furthermore, changes in L-octanoylcarnitine and lactosylceramide independently predicted ba-PWV changes, as did baseline BMI and changes in SBP.
PMC4363527	D00057	This finding suggests that the duration of overweight is an important aggravating factor for arterial stiffness, especially during middle age, and that this increased arterial stiffness might be associated with an age-related increase in plasma L-octanoylcarnitine and lactosylceramide.
PMC4363527	M01004	After a 12-hour fasting period, avoid 12-hours of intake meal including alcohol and caffeine consumption, venous blood specimens were collected in EDTA-treated and plain tubes and centrifuged to yield plasma or serum, which were stored at -70°C until analysis.

PMC4363527	R00002	At baseline, the overweight group showed higher BMI, waist circumference, triglycerides, FFA, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and hs-CRP, and lower HDL-cholesterol than controls.
PMC4363527	R00003	Similarly, after 3 years the overweight group showed higher BMI, waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP and DBP), triglyceride, FFA, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, and ba-PWV, and lower HDL-cholesterol than controls.
PMC4363527	R00004	Moreover, at the 3-year follow-up the overweight group showed an increase in waist circumference, SBP and DBP, FFA, insulin, HOMA-IR, and ba-PWV compared with baseline levels, and the changes in waist circumference, SBP, DBP, triglyceride, FFA, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, hs-CRP, and ba-PWV observed in the overweight group were significantly different from those in the normal weight group after adjusting for baseline levels.
PMC4363527	R00007	There were no significant differences in total energy expenditure or the proportion of subjects who smoke and/or drink alcohol between the baseline and 3-year follow-up data (data not shown).
PMC4363527	R01020	After the 3-year follow-up, the control group showed significant decreases in the following 12 metabolites: lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs) containing C14:0, C16:1, C16:0, C17:0, C18:1, C18:0, C20:4, C20:3, and C22:6 (Suppl. 1), PC (16:0/18:1), PC (18:0/18:2), and PC (18:0/20:4).
PMC4363527	R01021	The overweight group showed significant decreases in 11 metabolites—lysoPCs containing C14:0, C16:1, C16:0, C17:0, C18:2, C18:1, C18:0, C20:4, C20:3, and C22:6 (Suppl. 1), and PC (18:0/20:4)—and significant increases in 6 metabolites—L-leucine, palmitic amide, L-octanoylcarnitine, decanoylcarnitine, PC (18:2/18:2), and lactosylceramide.
PMC4363527	R01023	The overweight group showed greater increases in L-octanoylcarnitine (q = 0.006) and decanoylcarnitine (q = 0.007) than the control group and higher peak intensities of L-leucine, L-octanoylcarnitine, and decanoylcarnitine at the 3-year follow-up compared with the control group.
PMC4363527	R01024	The level of L-octanoylcarnitine at 3-year follow-up was significantly higher in overweight group, when the subjects were divided according to sex or menopause status (q = 0.002 in male, q = 0.001 in female; q = 0.012 in pre-menopause, q = 0.017 in post-menopause, respectively).
PMC4363527	R03003	After the 3-year follow-up, the control group showed significant decreases in the following 12 metabolites: lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs) containing C14:0, C16:1, C16:0, C17:0, C18:1, C18:0, C20:4, C20:3, and C22:6 (Suppl. 1), PC (16:0/18:1), PC (18:0/18:2), and PC (18:0/20:4).
PMC4363527	R03004	The overweight group showed significant decreases in 11 metabolites—lysoPCs containing C14:0, C16:1, C16:0, C17:0, C18:2, C18:1, C18:0, C20:4, C20:3, and C22:6 (Suppl. 1), and PC (18:0/20:4)—and significant increases in 6 metabolites—L-leucine, palmitic amide, L-octanoylcarnitine, decanoylcarnitine, PC (18:2/18:2), and lactosylceramide.
PMC4363527	R03006	The overweight group showed greater increases in L-octanoylcarnitine (q = 0.006) and decanoylcarnitine (q = 0.007) than the control group and higher peak intensities of L-leucine, L-octanoylcarnitine, and decanoylcarnitine at the 3-year follow-up compared with the control group.
PMC4363527	R03007	The level of L-octanoylcarnitine at 3-year follow-up was significantly higher in overweight group, when the subjects were divided according to sex or menopause status (q = 0.002 in male, q = 0.001 in female; q = 0.012 in pre-menopause, q = 0.017 in post-menopause, respectively).
PMC4363527	R04000	In all subjects (n = 118), changes (△) in ba-PWV positively correlated with △ waist circumference (r = 0.294, P = 0.001), △ WHR (r = 0.268, P = 0.003), △ SBP (r = 0.319, P< 0.001), △ triglyceride (r = 0.214, P = 0.020), △ hs-CRP (r = 0.233, P = 0.012), △ L-octanoylcarnitine (r = 0.528, P <0.001), △ decanoylcarnitine (r = 0.452, P <0.001), and △ lactosylceramide (r = 0.288, P = 0.002).

PMC4363527	R04003	Changes in L-octanoylcarnitine (standardized β = 0.428, P = 0.003) and lactosylceramide (standardized β = 0.201, P = 0.012) were the strongest independent predictors of △ ba-PWV, although baseline BMI (standardized β = 0.185, P = 0.034) and △ SBP (standardized β = 0.196, P = 0.020) were also significant.
PMC4363527	R05000	Changes in L-octanoylcarnitine positively correlated with △ WHR, △ total cholesterol, △ FFA, △ L-leucine, △ L-phenylalanine, and △ decanoylcarnitine (r = 0.815, P <0.001).

PMC4396978	A02004	FS animals raise the baseline degree of proteolysis to provide additional amino acids for energy production while CPF animals rely on both glucose and, to a lesser extent, amino acids.
PMC4396978	D01001	The presence of citric acid cycle intermediates in CPF urine implies that the capacity of the electron transport chain was exceeded as a result of the pre-feed.
PMC4396978	D01002	Glucose availability appears to promote anabolic activity in the liver.
PMC4396978	D01003	a) Higher levels of glucose are observed in liver, muscle, and serum of CPF animals.
PMC4396978	D01004	Urine choline and betaine as well as a reduced level of muscle ATP support the hypothesis of enhanced glucose-associated biosynthesis.
PMC4396978	D01005	Formation of a mitochondrial megachannel that allows for exit of citric acid cycle intermediates is suggested by elevated levels of fumarate, succinate, and citrate in the urine of CPF animals.
PMC4396978	D01007	Levels of liver, muscle, and serum BCAAs (isoleucine, leucine, and valine) as well as serum AA (tyrosine, serine, and threonine) are all higher in fasted animals at baseline suggesting increased proteolysis.
PMC4396978	D01008	The difference in the levels of serum urea (#) approach significance (p = 0.09) further supporting this hypothesis.
PMC4396978	D01013	Higher levels of maltose and sucrose in the liver of CPF animals arise from the metabolism of the carbohydrate pre-feed (Karo syrup).
PMC4396978	D01014	As would be anticipated from a pre-surgical carbohydrate feed, glucose levels are higher in all four compartments at baseline in pre-fed animals.
PMC4396978	D01015	The presence of glucose and lactate as well as the non-glycolytic end products of glucose (mannose and 1,6-anhydro-β-D-glucose) in the urine suggest that the ingested carbohydrate load was greater that the physiologic capacity to aerobically process the load.
PMC4396978	D01016	Under high glucose-load conditions, sustained activity of the citric acid cycle results in maximal ATP levels.
PMC4396978	D01017	The increased ATP/ADP ratio inhibits F_1 F_0 ATP synthase and produces a high mitochondrial membrane potential.
PMC4396978	D01019	This scenario can result in the accumulation and release of citric acid cycle intermediates from the mitochondria with eventual transport into the blood for use by other tissues or for excretion [–].
PMC4396978	D01023	Baseline levels of several citric acid cycle intermediates (pyruvate, citrate, α-ketoglutarate, succinate, and fumarate) are higher by up to 3-fold in the urine of CPF animals compared to FS animals.
PMC4396978	D01025	The time differential between the pre-feed and baseline sample collection may account for non-differentiating citric acid cycle intermediates in the other three compartments.
PMC4396978	D01027	Degradation of amino acids produces end products that enter the citric acid cycle for the eventual production of ATP.
PMC4396978	D01028	Levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine (branched chain amino acids, BCAA) are higher in the liver, muscle, and serum of fasted animals when compared to CPF animals.
PMC4396978	D01030	Serum levels of the amino acids tyrosine, threonine, and serine as well as 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate (the ketoacid derived from isoleucine) are also greater in FS animals when compared to CPF animals.
PMC4396978	D01031	Higher levels of urea are also observed in the serum of FS animals.
PMC4396978	D01032	Urea is produced through a series of reactions that are initiated with the transfer of a liberated amino group to glutamate.
PMC4396978	D01033	Rather than being an intermediate in the production of urea, glutamate can be enzymatically converted to glutamine.
PMC4396978	D01034	In the liver of CPF animals levels of glutamine are greater when compared to FS animals.
PMC4396978	D01036	Higher levels of O-phosphocholine are observed in the liver of CPF animals when compared to FS animals.
PMC4396978	D01037	O-phosphocholine is a precursor of phosphatidylcholine.
PMC4396978	D01038	Phophatidylcholine can be incorporated into biological membranes or can be hydrolyzed by lipases eventually releasing choline.
PMC4396978	D01039	One biological fate of choline is oxidation to betaine (trimethylglycine) with the concurrent transfer of a methyl group to methionine.
PMC4396978	D01040	Methionine can be further processed to produce numerous biosynthetic entities such as purines and glutathione.
PMC4396978	D01041	Levels of choline and betaine are higher in the urine of CPF animals when compared to FS animals.
PMC4396978	D01042	These observations support the hypothesis that phosphatidylcholine is being converted into the methyl donor betaine (via choline) for biosynthetic activities.
PMC4396978	D01043	This hypothesis would be in accordance with the use of glucose as an anabolic fuel.
PMC4396978	D01044	Further support for increased anabolic activity comes from the ATP differential in muscle.
PMC4396978	D01045	Biosynthetic activity requires ATP.
PMC4396978	D01046	The lower level of ATP in the muscle of CPF animals, despite the greater availability of glucose, could be attributed to a higher level of biosynthetic activity in the muscle of these animals.
PMC4396978	D01048	Glucose provision is associated with biosynthetic activities that involve the transfer of a methyl group.
PMC4396978	D01049	The methyl group is donated by conversion of betaine to dimethylglycine (DMG) or from the folate cycle, both actions generating S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH).
PMC4396978	D01050	Biomolecules generated include purines, proteins, creatine, taurine, and glutathione.
PMC4396978	D01053	The level of hypoxanthine (HX) is higher in the liver of CPF animals when compared to FS animals.
PMC4396978	D01054	Liver hypoxanthine is not in the selected 10 liver metabolites, however it did exhibit a VIP score above 1.00 (VIP = 1.073) indicating its relevance.
PMC4396978	D01055	An exploration of its production provides additional support for the anabolic state associated with glucose provision.
PMC4396978	D01056	Under normal conditions (non-stress), some degradation of ATP accompanies de novo synthesis.
PMC4396978	D01057	HX is an intermediate in the degradation of ATP and gets excreted in the urine.
PMC4396978	D01058	The ATP degradation pathway is constructed in such a manner that intermediates can be diverted to meet altered physiologic situations.
PMC4396978	D01059	As observed in , inosine monophosphate (IMP) can be salvaged to regenerate ATP.
PMC4396978	D01060	Enhanced purine salvage has been observed in an animal model of food deprivation.
PMC4396978	D01061	At baseline levels of HX are higher in the liver of CPF animals when compared to FS animals.
PMC4396978	D01062	Although not differentiating, levels of HX are also higher by ~2 fold in the urine of CPF animals when compared to FS animals at baseline.
PMC4396978	D01063	We suggest that the difference in HX levels supports the concept of greater purine salvage in FS animals at baseline.
PMC4396978	D01064	Metabolomics evidence from four compartments suggests alternate routes for observed differences in purine abundances.
PMC4396978	D01065	ATP is degraded in a series of reactions to uric acid or allantoin.
PMC4396978	D01068	For example, during fasting, IMP can be salvaged for the production of ATP thus reducing the level of HX.
PMC4396978	D01069	In our study, HX levels are higher at baseline in liver of CPF animals.
PMC4396978	D01071	During ischemia 5'-nucleotidase acts on AMP to generate adenosine, a potential vasodilator.
PMC4396978	D01072	In our study, adenosine levels are ~3X higher in the liver of CPF animals when compared to FS animals suggesting a greater need for vasodilation.
PMC4396978	D02001	FS animals exhibit a drop in muscle phosphocreatine (PCr) that is nearly four times that observed in CPF animals.
PMC4396978	D02002	The change in liver HX levels differentiates CPF from FS animals and potentially arises from the greater conversion of AMP (HX precursor) to adenosine in CPF animals.
PMC4396978	D02006	Glucose levels increase from baseline in the liver, muscle, and serum.
PMC4396978	D02007	This is attributed to the breakdown of glycogen.
PMC4396978	D02008	The increase is greater in CPF animals presumably due to the enhanced glycogen stores in CPF animals.
PMC4396978	D02009	Both tissues also exhibit increased levels of BCAA (isoleucine, leucine, valine), suggesting more proteolysis during shock than at baseline.
PMC4396978	D02011	Muscle creatine phosphate (PCr) levels decrease in both groups during shock compared to baseline but the decrease is greater by almost 4-fold in FS animals when compared to CPF animals.
PMC4396978	D02012	Since muscle ATP levels are not differentiating between the two groups, FS animals appeared to rely more heavily on this non-oxidative mode of ATP generation.
PMC4396978	D02013	Alanine levels (^) increase to a greater extent in the muscle of FS animals.
PMC4396978	D02014	This difference could reflect the time lag necessary to shift the metabolic machinery dedicated to glucose use in CPF animals at baseline to that necessary to process the greater load of amino acids at shock.
PMC4396978	D02019	With the onset of trauma and hemorrhagic shock, glucagon is released and initiates the breakdown of glycogen stores.
PMC4396978	D02020	In CPF animals, liver, serum, and muscle levels of glucose increase from baseline.
PMC4396978	D02021	While liver and muscle glucose levels increase in FS animals as well, the level of serum glucose drops when compared to baseline.
PMC4396978	D02022	This decrease is most likely due to low glycogen levels in FS animals connected to an overnight fast [–].
PMC4396978	D02023	Lactate levels increase in both liver and muscle (not differentiating) over baseline in both groups.
PMC4396978	D02024	In addition to mobilizing glucose, increased proteolysis is observed in both groups (BCAA FS increase > BCAA CPF increase).
PMC4396978	D02025	A larger increase in the level of the gluconeogenic and/or urea precursor alanine in FS muscle parallels the BCAA pattern.
PMC4396978	D02026	Despite smaller increases of BCAA to be processed in CPF animals, levels of two BCAA catabolic products (3-methyl-2-oxovalerate originating from isoleucine and 3-hydroxyisovalerate from leucine) increase in the serum of CPF animals while showing minimal change or a decrease in FS animals.
PMC4396978	D02028	Up to the point of shock induction, metabolic machinery in CPF animals was most likely dedicated to glucose metabolism; amino acid metabolism was supplemental.
PMC4396978	D02029	Hypoxanthine levels decrease to a small extent in the liver of CPF animals but increase in the liver of FS.
PMC4396978	D02030	These changes result in higher HX levels in FS animals during the shock phase when compared to CPF levels (FS = 0.223, CPF
PMC4396978	D02032	HX accumulates during ischemia due to the catabolism of ATP.
PMC4396978	D02033	Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is an intermediate in the catabolism of ATP.
PMC4396978	D02034	During vasoconstrictive events such as hemorrhage, 5-nucleotidase hydrolyzes AMP to generate adenosine.
PMC4396978	D02035	Adenosine is a vasodilator.
PMC4396978	D02036	Examination of liver adenosine levels (VIP = 0.859) reveals that the increase over baseline in CPF animals is nearly 3 times that observed in FS animals.
PMC4396978	D02037	This prioritization (diversion to adenosine production) is one potential explanation for the differences in HX concentrations.
PMC4396978	D03001	Information evident in the urine supports greater ATP degradation in CPF animals.
PMC4396978	D03004	Lactate levels correspondingly decrease in the liver and serum as do downstream catabolic products of BCAAs.
PMC4396978	D03008	Although both FS and CPF animals exhibit a decrease in levels of muscle ATP at this time, the decrease in the level of FS muscle ATP is ~25 times greater than that seen in CPF animals.
PMC4396978	D03011	Levels of glucose and a number of glucose-related metabolites (1,6-anhydro-β-D-glucose, mannose, lactose) increase in the urine (CPF increase > FS increase).
PMC4396978	D03013	Levels of HX are ~2 times greater in the urine of CPF animals when compared to FS animals.
PMC4396978	D03014	It is unclear from our data why the level of HX is higher in the urine of CPF animals at this time interval.
PMC4396978	D03015	Continued degradation of HX produces uric acid that gets excreted in the urine.
PMC4396978	D03016	Uric acid has the potential to induce renal dysfunction.
PMC4396978	D03017	This dysfunction is correlated with an increased observation of trimethylamine-N-oxide.
PMC4396978	D03018	The urine of CPF animals displays a higher level of trimethylamine-N-oxide when compared to FS animals.
PMC4396978	D03019	Greater levels of urine HX as well as trimethylamine-N-oxide suggest greater stress in CPF animals but it cannot be determined from urine data if it arises during the shock phase or during resuscitation (or both).
PMC4396978	D03026	Glycerol may be considered a surrogate to lipids, but this was not identified as a VIP; otherwise, lipids were not considered in this study.
PMC4396978	D04002	FS animals raise the existing degree of proteolysis to provide additional amino acids for energy production while CPF animals rely on both glucose and, to a lesser extent, amino acids.

PMC4446197	R00004	Since these DS derivatives are produced under mild reaction conditions, other molecules containing the sulfonyl chloride moiety and a proton-affinity group were investigated.

PMC4446197	R00006	Among them, the derivatives of pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride appears to be more diagnostically valuable by showing estrogen-specific fragmentations by ESI MRM using triple quadrupole MS with a LOD of 10 pg/mL for E2.
PMC4446197	R00007	A more sensitive picolinoyl derivatization approach with a claimed LOD of 0.5 pg/mL and 1.0 pg/mL for E2 and E1, respectively, was proposed using ESI-SRM [,].

PMC4446197	R00013	Dried extracts were treated with sulfonyl chloride and sodium bicarbonate in a simple one-step reaction, and the resulting reaction mixture was directly subjected to LC/MS analysis without further purification.
PMC4446197	R00014	The derivatization with the picolinoyl reagent, on the other hand, involves more steps, and requires the use of freshly prepared and highly concentrated derivatizing reagents in strictly anhydrous solvents.
PMC4446197	R00016	Moreover, both phenolic and aliphatic alcohols are modified using this method, which leads to several reaction products that complicate data quantification.
PMC4446197	R00018	The most sensitive quantification was achieved using exact masses of the protonated [M+H]_+ ions for DS, P, and PS derivatives.
PMC4446197	R00019	Since all tags contain proton-affine groups, the use of 0.1% formic acid in the mobile phase facilitates the formation of pre-charged [M+H]_+ ions and hence improves sensitivity.
PMC4446197	R00027	PS products showed a similar range with 1.9–30 pg/mL by FS and 0.2–15 pg/mL by tSIM.
PMC4446197	R00028	Surprisingly, the LODs of P derivatization were 3–200 pg/mL by FS and significantly higher than the DS and PS products; tSIM for P products were only carried out for selected estrogen metabolites and showed a LOD range of 3–25 pg/mL, 2–20 times higher than DS products.
PMC4446197	R00030	DS products showed better chromatographic separation than PS products, the analytes were eluted between 3 and 24 min, whereas for PS products elution was in a narrow range between 11 and 20 min.

PMC4446197	R00036	In our search to improve the sensitivity of DS products, we considered reagents containing a sulfonyl chloride group since this group readily and quantitatively reacts with phenolic moieties in mild conditions, and contains a proton-affine group to assure easy ionization for sensitive MS detection.
PMC4446197	R00037	Hence, the commercially available 1-methylimidazole-2-sulfonyl chloride (ISCl) and 2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-3-pyridinesulfonyl chloride were selected to derivatize steroids.
PMC4446197	R00038	These two compounds contain the desired proton-affine imidazole and triazole groups to improve + ESI sensitivity.
PMC4446197	R00039	Structurally similar imidazole tags (1,2-dimethylimidazole-4-sulfonyl chloride) have been used previously to derivatize estrogens but their less desirable chromatographic properties and non-specific fragmentation ions under SRM have hindered their application.
PMC4446197	R00042	The derivatization reaction with 1-methylimidazole-2-sulfonyl chloride (ISCl) was carried out in mild conditions similar to the dansylation reaction in the presence of sodium bicarbonate.
PMC4446197	R00043	However, the reaction with 2-(1H-1,2,4-triazol-1-yl)-3-pyridinesulfonyl chloride failed due to impurities of the commercial compound (data not shown).
PMC4446197	R00044	The reaction products with ISCl were separated using an Ascentis C18 column with 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as mobile phase, similar to the chromatographic conditions of dansyl derivatives.
PMC4446197	R00045	Since the imidazole is smaller than the dansyl moiety and less lipophilic, all compounds eluted between 5 and 14 min and the total run time was shorter (20 min) than that of the DS derivatives (35 min) and requires less organic solvent (underivatized Prog RT = 9 min, 2nd peak in DS; and RT = 13 min, last peak in IS).
PMC4519008	A00011	In the CRC study, SPICA identified 6461 statistically significant ion-pairs, several of which putatively mapped to folic acid biosynthesis, a key pathway in colorectal cancer.
PMC4519008	D00017	A common normalization technique for urine metabolomics involves normalizing all abundance values by creatinine, which is one of the most abundant metabolites in urine, and a good indicator of kidney function.
PMC4519008	D00018	In a sense, it is a form of ion-pair analysis, as every ion is paired to creatinine.
PMC4519008	R04019	Analysis of both the single-mapped features, i.e. ion-pairs in which both constituent ions map to the same metabolic pathway, as well as the dual-mapped features, i.e. ion-pairs in which the ions map to different pathways, yielded lysine biosynthesis (ko00300) and lysine degradation (ko00301) as statistically significant (P < 0.10, FDR corrected).
PMC4519008	R04020	Poly-L-lysine has been linked to hematopoietic stem cell differentiation, and amino acids in general play a role in forming free radicals as a result of ionizing radiation exposure.
PMC4519008	R04021	Analysis of the dual-mapped features also yielded folate biosynthesis (ko00790) as being statistically significant, which has been directly linked to radiation exposure.
PMC4519008	R04022	Furthermore, an MDS plot produced from analysis of dual-mapped features indicates that the folate biosynthesis pathway is differentially perturbed when compared to the perturbation of the two lysine pathways, which are nearly identical (most likely the result of many shared ion-pair features).
PMC4519008	R04023	This may suggest that the ion-pair features mapped to the folate pathway may reveal different underlying mechanisms from that of the lysine pathways.
PMC4519008	R04024	Putative KEGG metabolic pathway analysis of both the single-mapped (A) and dual-mapped (B) ion-pair features of the TBI data yields lysine biosynthesis (ko00300) and degradation (ko00301) as being statistically significantly perturbed (P < 0.1, FDR corrected), though dual-mapped features reveal folate biosynthesis (ko00790) as being affected as well.
PMC4519008	R04025	Additional analysis of dual-mapped features produced an MDS plot (C) visualizing both magnitude and direction of perturbation, and reveals folate biosynthesis perturbation as being distinct from the perturbation direction of the lysine pathways.
PMC4519008	R05015	The results indicate that by far the most significantly perturbed KEGG pathway was folate biosynthesis (ko00790).
PMC4519008	R05016	Increased dietary folate intake has been strongly linked with a decrease in CRC risk.
PMC4519008	R05017	Other pathways found to be statistically significant (P < 0.10, FDR corrected) include propanoate metabolism (ko00640), as well as GABAergic synapse (ko04727), sphingolipid metabolism (ko00600), and several other pathways, many of which have been identified in the literature as being associated with colorectal cancer.
PMC4519008	R05018	The MDS plot suggests that the perturbation of the folate biosynthesis pathway is distinctly different from the perturbation of other pathways, and also suggests that tryptophan metabolism (ko00380), not seen in the more traditional pathway analysis procedure, may be significant, and indeed the literature suggests that tryptophan levels are associated with quality of life in CRC patients.
PMC4519008	R05020	The most significant pathway identified, folate biosynthesis (ko00790), is of particular interest, as a high folate diet has been strongly linked with a decrease in CRC risk.
PMC4519008	R05021	Additional analysis of dual-mapped features produced an MDS plot (B) visualizing both magnitude and direction of perturbation, and reveals an additional pathway, tryptophan metabolism (ko00380), as potentially playing a role as well.
PMC4525490	A00001	Although it is well established that arterial blood generally has higher concentrations of glucose and oxygen relative to venous blood, a comprehensive biochemical characterization of arteriovenous differences has not yet been reported.
PMC4525490	A00004	While we detected changes in lactic acid, alanine, glutamine, and glutamate as expected from skeletal muscle activity, a number of unanticipated metabolites were also determined to be significantly altered including Krebs cycle intermediates, amino acids that have not been previously implicated in transport, and a few oxidized fatty acids.
PMC4525490	A01006	Beyond measurements of oxygen consumption coupled to the measurement of glucose uptake and early amino acid balance studies across major organs_, _, _, _, , surprisingly little research has been performed on metabolic blood homeostasis at different levels of the circulatory system.
PMC4525490	D00011	The postabsorptive metabolic state in muscle is primarily associated with an increase in glycolysis, resulting in an excess of pyruvate_, .
PMC4525490	D00012	Our observations indicate that the excess of pyruvate independently governs the production of lactate, and the production of alanine via transamination of glutamate.
PMC4525490	D00013	The significantly higher lactate level in venous plasma (referred to as negative arteriovenous balance) is likely associated with its release to venous plasma as the end-product of pyruvate conversion.
PMC4525490	D00014	This observation is congruent with earlier findings on peripheral lactate levels_, and is representative of incomplete glycolysis even at rest, in aerobic conditions at early fasting metabolic state.
PMC4525490	D00015	It also demonstrates the role of lactate as a mobile nutrient (gluconeogenic metabolite) that is further taken up by the liver to regenerate glucose and complete the Cori cycle_, .
PMC4525490	D00016	The observations of a significantly lower levels of glutamate (positive AV balance), and increased levels of alanine (negative AV balance) and glutamine (negative AV balance) in venous plasma imply the uptake of glutamate (by muscle) and the production and release of alanine and glutamine by transamination.
PMC4525490	D00017	While early metabolic studies demonstrated the synthesis of glutamine and alanine, as two main gluconeogenic amino acids formed by transamination of α-ketoacids (pyruvate and oxaloacetate, ) in muscle_, , the uptake pattern of glutamate by human muscle has been reported only by Marliss et al. using enzymatic assays.
PMC4525490	D00018	Our results reflect a significant uptake pattern of glutamate suggesting that glutamate is the major amino acid precursor, primarily as a nitrogen donor, in the synthesis of alanine and glutamine.
PMC4525490	D00019	Furthermore, a significant positive arteriovenous difference was observed for aspartate, suggesting that aspartate could play an important role in glutamate supply in the muscle cells.
PMC4525490	D00020	The uptake of aspartate by muscle is a new finding that is likely coupled to excess of α-ketoglutarate, produced by transamination of glutamate.
PMC4525490	D00021	The excess of α-ketoglutarate could lead the amino transfer from aspartate to glutamate and concurrently replenish the TCA-cycle.
PMC4525490	D00022	Early tracing experiments using rat muscle in vitro indicate that glutamate, aspartate and specific branched amino acids (isoleucine and valine) should enter the TCA cycle and serve as carbon skeleton and nitrogen supply for glutamine synthesis_, , however only the uptake pattern of glutamate has been previously reported, The uptake pattern of serine, reflected as lower concentration in venous blood, is a new finding as well, which may imply its usage for pyruvate anaplerosis, as a non-carbohydrate precursor, by serine dehydratase mediated direct conversion to pyruvate.
PMC4525490	D00023	This finding supports the original formulation of the glucose-alanine cycle after which pyruvate is derived from glucose as well as other metabolized amino acids.
PMC4525490	D00024	Tracer experiments in humans in vivo have implied that the carbon atoms of alanine are mostly derived from plasma glucose and muscle glycogen_, and that glutamine should be a major gluconeogenic precursor for a positive transfer of new carbon to the glucose pool_, , originating primarily from protein-derived amino acids.
PMC4525490	D00025	Therefore, the hypothesis of serine deamination for pyruvate anaplerosis needs to be further investigated.
PMC4525490	D00026	The observed significant arteriovenous metabolite changes that fit into the context are pointed out in red (glucose, glutamate, aspartate, serine) and blue (lactate, alanine, glutamine and succinate).
PMC4525490	D00027	The uptake pattern of glucose, glutamate, aspartate and serine (in addition to being formed by breakdown of muscle proteins) demonstrates their use by muscle cells as supply for TCA cycle as well as nitrogen and/or carbon donors in the synthesis of alanine, glutamine and other amino acids.
PMC4525490	D00028	Lactate, alanine, glutamine and succinate produced by muscle cells are released into the venous blood.
PMC4525490	D00029	α-KG—α-ketoglutarate, OAA—oxaloacetate, αAA—α-aminoacids, αKA—α-ketoacids.
PMC4525490	D00031	Although substantial release of free amino acids from muscle tissue (reflecting the muscle protein undergoing degradation) after an overnight fast has been reported in early studies_, , and we did observe the negative arteriovenous differences for most of the quantified amino acids, only the release of alanine, glutamine and phenylalanine were observed at statistically significant levels.
PMC4525490	D00032	This implies that specific biochemical pathways that support primarily gluconeogenic metabolite synthesis (lactate, alanine, glutamine and phenylalanine) are dominant in human postabsorptive metabolic state.
PMC4525490	D00033	Overall, our results suggest that glutamate and aspartate are metabolized by muscle as primary nitrogen and/or carbon donors in the synthesis of other gluconeogenic metabolites, as demonstrated by their highly significant positive arteriovenous balance.
PMC4525490	D00034	The increased levels of TCA-cycle intermediates (e.g. succinate, malate, and ) in venous plasma suggest that the metabolized amino acids are converted into TCA cycle intermediates that can be released to venous blood and/or used as carbon source mainly for the synthesis of glutamine_, .
PMC4525490	D00035	Alanine seems to be directly produced by transamination of pyruvate, using the “uptaken” glutamate as nitrogen donor.
PMC4525490	D00036	These observations affirm that muscle is a key gluconeogenic site in the body and provide some new, potentially physiologically important insights into its metabolic activity regarding the unanticipated role of aspartate and serine, related to the inter-organ carbon and nitrogen transfer via the Cori and analogous Glucose-Alanine cycle, to meet the energy needs of different cell types.
PMC4525490	D00037	Beyond the above mentioned arteriovenous differences related to muscle metabolism, distinct metabolites, including oxidized fatty acids (HPODE family) and sialic acid may reflect the oxidation state difference between the arterial and venous plasma_, _, _, _, _, .
PMC4525490	D00039	It is noteworthy that HPODEs, the products of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated peroxidation of linoleates and the primary products of the autoxidation process, are considered as potential biomarkers for oxidative stress status in vivo _, .
PMC4525490	D00047	The observed differences highlight the roles of glutamate, lactate, glutamine and alanine, and the unanticipated roles of aspartate, serine and succinate as carbon and nitrogen shuttles in the body mainly via Cori and Glucose-Alanine cycle.
PMC4525490	M00001	The subjects were screened by age (18 lower limit), body mass index (18–31) and applying the following clinical criteria: no hormone contraceptives, no topical estrogen agents, no statins/lipid lowering agents, no allergy medications at least 2 weeks prior to blood drawing, no diabetic medications, no anti-inflammatory medications at least 2 weeks prior to blood drawing, no heart failure medications, no anti-hypertensive medications and no anticoagulants.
PMC4525490	M00005	A total of 3 mL of each blood were drawn using the Marquest™ Gaslyte® blood sampler with lyophilized lithium heparin as an anticoagulant.
PMC4525490	M00006	The samples were immediately transferred from the heparin syringe into labeled aliquot tube and centrifuged at 4 °C at 2000 rpm for 20 min.
PMC4525490	M01000	Human plasma samples (100 μL) were extracted using 400 μL of cold MeOH:ACN (1:1, v/v) to maintain MeOH:ACN:H_2 O
PMC4525490	M02002	For HILIC in ESI negative mode, the mobile phase was composed of A = 20 mM ammonium acetate and 20 mM ammonium hydroxide in 95% water and B = 95% acetonitrile.
PMC4525490	M04000	A YSI 2900 Bioanalyzer was used to determine the absolute concentration of glutamine, glutamate, glucose, and lactate in plasma, according to manufacturer’s instructions.
PMC4525490	M04002	25 uL of plasma was used per measurement and glutamine/glutamate and glucose/lactate were measured concomitantly.
PMC4525490	R00002	The approach using hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled with negative ionization mode mass spectrometry based on 80% methanol extraction was applied to maximize the coverage of central carbon metabolites in human plasma.
PMC4525490	R00006	Many nutrients and metabolic by-products transported in plasma were analyzed across all subjects, including amino and non-amino organic acids, purines and pyrimidines, endogenous sugars, fatty acids, and dietary metabolites and their breakdown products (e.g. tagatose, paraxanthine).
PMC4525490	R00010	Glutamate showed a significant decrease in venous vs. arterial plasma (p = 3.8E-06, median fold change = 2.9, ) across all 20 subjects.
PMC4525490	R00011	Lactate demonstrated consistent difference characterized by significant increase in venous plasma (p = 4.2E-04, median fold change = 1.4, ).
PMC4525490	R00023	The changes revealed by untargeted metabolite profiling (p < 0.0001, Wilcoxon matched pairs rank test) were identified as glutamate and lactate, respectively, by MS/MS matching against standards in the METLIN database and validated by targeted analysis (paired plots).
PMC4525490	R00030	Numerous amino acids (21) and other non-amino organic acids, playing an important role in carbon and nitrogen shuttle through glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were targeted together with glutamate and lactate.
PMC4525490	R00031	To interrogate differences highlighted by untargeted analysis further, targeted quantification was also expanded to include tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, the intermediates of purine and of phenylalanine metabolism.
PMC4525490	R01004	Lactate, was measured together with glucose, as the most abundant among the quantified metabolites (1453 ± 109.4 μM in arterial and 1728 ±
PMC4525490	R01005	 180.1 μM in venous plasma, ), followed by amino acids (glutamine, glutamate) also detected in high concentrations (≥100 μM) in arterial and venous plasma.
PMC4525490	R01007	Although subtle, the arteriovenous fold changes (from V/A = 1.09 fold for sialic acid to A/V = 3.02 fold for glutamate, , ) were consistent across the majority of analyzed subjects.
PMC4525490	R01008	Glutamate showed the highest uptake pattern (or the highest positive arteriovenous balance (3.02 ± 0.32 fold lower in venous plasma,
PMC4525490	R01009	p < 0.0001, and ) while lactate (1.31 ± 0.06 fold higher in venous plasma, p < 0.0001, and ) and succinate (1.56 ± 0.09 fold higher in venous plasma, p < 0.0001, ) displayed the most significant release pattern across human forearm tissue.
PMC4525490	R01010	In addition to glutamate; aspartate and serine displayed consistent uptake patterns as well, with significantly decreased levels in venous vs. arterial plasma while alanine, glutamine and phenylalanine together with lactate, succinate, malate and sialic acid exhibited a consistent release pattern with significantly increased levels in venous vs. arterial plasma ( and ).
PMC4525490	R01011	The majority of other targeted amino acids exhibited higher content in venous plasma (qualified as negative arteriovenous balance, e.g. tryptophan, cystine, arginine, aspargine, glycine, histidine, ornithine, ), although the difference was not statistically significant.
PMC4525490	R01012	The exceptions were branched amino acids (BAA: leucine, isoleucine and valine), which displayed a positive arteriovenous balance (like previously mentioned glutamate, aspartate and serine) although the statistical significance for BAA was not reached.
PMC4525767	A00001	We sought to test the hypothesis that circulating BCAA, aromatic AA and related AA metabolites decline in response to the use of insulin sensitizing agents in overweight/obese adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes.
PMC4525767	A01000	We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo, controlled study conducted in twenty five overweight/obese (BMI~30 kg/m_2 ) adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes.
PMC4525767	A01001	Participants were randomized to three months of pioglitazone (45 mg per day) plus metformin (1000 mg twice per day, N = 12 participants) or placebo (N = 13).
PMC4525767	A02001	Moreover, insulin sensitizer therapy significantly reduced three functionally clustered AA and metabolite pairs: i) phenylalanine/tyrosine, ii) citrulline/arginine, and iii) lysine/α-aminoadipic acid.
PMC4525767	D00000	The present investigation demonstrates that three months of dual insulin sensitizer therapy (metformin plus pioglitazone) on average reduces fasting plasma AA and AA metabolite concentrations in overweight/obese adults with fasting hyperglycemia or previously untreated T2D. The major new finding was that insulin sensitizer therapy resulted in reduced concentrations of three functional pairs of AA/AA metabolites: 1) phenylalanine and tyrosine, 2) lysine and α-aminoadipic acid, and 3) arginine and citrulline.
PMC4525767	D00002	Together, these findings support the premise that enhanced insulin action per se is responsible for the changes in these functional pairs of AA/AA metabolites, rather than being attributable to a more direct effect of the pharmacological agents, pioglitazone and/or metformin.
PMC4525767	D00003	An important finding of the present investigation is that dual insulin sensitizer therapy in overweight/obese adults with fasting hyperglycemia or previously untreated T2D reduces plasma concentrations of both phenylalanine and tyrosine ( and ).
PMC4525767	D00004	The combination of these two insulin sensitizers is commonly used in T2D. Of interest, increase in insulin sensitivity was not significantly correlated with the decline in fasting plasma phenylalanine or tyrosine.
PMC4525767	D00006	A previous report demonstrated that three months of metformin monotherapy reduces fasting AAA in people with T2D. Moreover, three months of pioglitazone has also been shown to reduce fasting AAA concentrations in people with NASH.
PMC4525767	D00010	Plasma BCAA concentrations may not have changed due to opposing effects of metformin and pioglitazone.
PMC4525767	D00011	It was shown, for example that two days of metformin therapy increased plasma BCAA in insulin resistant adults.
PMC4525767	D00012	In contrast, pioglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonist, promotes the degradation of BCAA by increasing the activity of BCKD in adipose tissue and has also been shown to reduce fasting plasma BCAA in obese patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.
PMC4525767	D00013	Six months of rosiglitazone, another PPARγ agonist, also reduces BCAA in patients with T2D. It is also feasible that the decline in fasting insulin offsets the increase in insulin sensitivity and insulin-mediated suppression skeletal muscle protein breakdown.
PMC4525767	D00014	In support of this possibility, the insulin sensitizer treatment had no effect on plasma 3-methylhistidine, a byproduct of myofibrillar protein breakdown.
PMC4525767	D00016	Indeed, elevations in insulin secretion associated with sitagliptin therapy lead to reduced circulating BCAA concentrations following a mixed meal in patients with T2D. Our findings are also consistent with a previous report in which it was shown that an alteration in insulin action on glucose metabolism following insulin treatment may not be accompanied by a change in the insulin effect on protein metabolism.
PMC4525767	D00020	For example, dietary leucine supplementation enhanced insulin action in high-fat fed rodents [,].
PMC4525767	D00021	Leucine, and its metabolite β-hydroxy-methylbutyrate (HMB), can act synergistically with pharmacological agents to increase their potency [–].
PMC4525767	D00022	When combined with metformin, leucine and HMB improved insulin sensitivity by activating AMPK and SIRT1.
PMC4525767	D00023	Leucine content is high in dairy products and has been identified as a key component for lowering the risk for T2D. In the present investigation insulin sensitizer therapy reduced the concentration of lysine, and its metabolite α-aminoadipic acid ( and ).
PMC4525767	D00024	In the presence of hyperglycemia, lysine can be converted to allysine through a non-enzymatic Strecker-type reaction.
PMC4525767	D00025	Oxidative stress and/or low concentrations of the anti-oxidant glutathione lead to further oxidation of allysine to α-aminoadipic acid.
PMC4525767	D00026	As a result, α-aminoadipic acid has been proposed as a potential biomarker of protein oxidation in T2D, is elevated in people with diabetes, and is a predictor for the future development of T2D. We previously demonstrated that insulin withdrawal for 8 hours increased oxidative stress, which was reflected by an accelerated oxidation of lysine to allysine in de novo synthesized apoA1 and a concomitant elevation in α-aminoadipic acid in people with type 1 diabetes.
PMC4525767	D00027	Therefore, we speculate that the insulin sensitizer induced reductions in α-aminoadipic acid reflect reductions in overall oxidative stress mediating further improvements in insulin sensitivity.
PMC4525767	D00028	Arginine and citrulline concentrations declined in response to insulin sensitizer therapy ( and ), but the underlying mechanism(s) are not yet clear.
PMC4525767	D00029	Arginine and citrulline are key components of nitric oxide biosynthesis and the urea.
PMC4525767	D00030	Reductions in citrulline likely reflect insulin sensitizer-induced reductions in urea biosynthesis, secondary to reductions in gluconeogenesis [,].
PMC4525767	D00031	Insulin acutely reduces ornithine level affecting the catabolic aspect of arginine metabolism consistent with the anti-catabolic effect of insulin on AA metabolism.
PMC4525767	D00032	Insulin sensitizer therapy also reduced the concentration of glutamic acid/glutamate ( and ).
PMC4525767	D00033	Glutamic acid/glutamate is an essential precursor for gluconeogenesis so the elevation in glutamic acid/glutamate may contribute to the development of fasting hyperglycemia in insulin-resistant states.
PMC4525767	D00034	Likewise, the reduced fasting glutamic acid/glutamate following pioglitazone and metformin treatment could contribute to a concomitant reduction in gluconeogenesis.
PMC4525767	D00035	Metformin has previously been shown to reduce gluconeogenesis and hepatic glucose production and this effect may be at least partially mediated via reduction in glutamic acid/glutamate concentration, although gluconeogenesis is highly regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.
PMC4525767	D00036	There is also recent evidence demonstrating that metformin suppresses gluconeogenesis by inhibiting mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase.
PMC4525767	D00037	Taken together, glutamic acid/glutamate may play a permissive role in the regulation of gluconeogenesis.
PMC4525767	D00041	Nevertheless, six AA and AA metabolites were reduced in both studies, and represent three functional pairs: i) phenylalanine and tyrosine, ii) lysine and α-aminoadipic acid, and iii) arginine and citrulline.
PMC4525767	D00044	Compared to placebo, nine amino acids and amino acid metabolites were reduced in response to three months of insulin sensitizer therapy in overweight/obese (BMI~30 kg/m_2 ) adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes (n = 13, placebo; n = 12 insulin sensitizer) (white circle).
PMC4525767	D00045	Three functional pairs of amino acids and amino acid metabolites (phenylalanine/tyrosine, lysine/α-aminoadipic acid, and arginine/citrulline) were reduced in response to both the acute infusion of insulin as well as three months of insulin sensitizer therapy.
PMC4525767	D00046	Finally, serine concentrations were reduced in response to the acute infusion of insulin, while it was increased in response to three months of insulin sensitizer therapy.
PMC4525767	D00051	Additionally, since we used both pioglitazone and metformin together their separate effects on the study outcomes have yet to be determined.
PMC4525767	D00052	In summary, three months of insulin sensitizer therapy with metformin and pioglitazone in a double-blind trial results in a global reduction in plasma AA and AA metabolite concentrations.
PMC4525767	D00054	Importantly, insulin sensitizer therapy significantly reduced three functional pairs of AA/AA metabolites (phenylalanine/tyrosine, lysine/α-aminoadipic acid, and arginine/citrulline).
PMC4525767	M01001	The current report primarily examines the effect of three months of insulin sensitizer therapy on plasma concentrations of BCAA, AAA, and AA metabolites in overweight/obese adults with fasting hyperglycemia, defined as either impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes.
PMC4525767	M01002	Briefly, 25 drug naïve, Northern European American participants with fasting blood glucose concentrations of 108–180 mg/dL were randomized to receive either 45 mg of pioglitazone per day plus 1 g of metformin twice per day (n=12) or placebo (n=13) for 12 weeks.
PMC4525767	M01003	We chose metformin based on its proven effect on hepatic insulin sensitivity and pioglitazone based on its effect on peripheral insulin sensitivity.
PMC4525767	M01009	Arterialized-venous blood was used to measure plasma glucose concentrations every 10 min using an automated glucose analyzer (GM9, Analox Instruments, London, UK).
PMC4525767	M01010	The glucose infusion rate (GIR) (40% dextrose) was adjusted to maintain euglycemia [~5.0 mmol/L (90 mg/dL)] during the 8h insulin infusion.
PMC4525767	M01011	Insulin sensitivity was defined as the steady-state glucose infusion rate (GIR, μmol/kg-FFM/min) achieved during the last 2h of the 8h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.
PMC4525767	M01012	Fasting glucose and insulin concentrations were used to calculate the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI = 1/log[glucose]+log[insulin]).
PMC4525767	M01017	Amino acids in particular are relatively stable for several years, with the exception of their keto-acids (e.g., KIC), which we have not included in the present analysis.
PMC4525767	M01022	Additionally, we measured plasma AA and AA metabolites in samples collected during a second study in which an acute (7-hours) infusion of insulin (1.5 mU/kg FFM/min) with glucose replacement and without AA replacement compared to saline alone (n = 9 each, both groups 5 M/4 F).
PMC4525767	R00001	In brief, the participants had a mean age of ~52 y, BMI of ~31 kg/m_2 , body fat of ~45%, fasting glucose of ~126 mg/dL, fasting insulin of ~13 μU/mL and steady-state glucose infusion rate during the hyperinsulinemic clamp of ~25 μmol/kgFFM/min.
PMC4525767	R00002	All of these outcomes are consistent with a phenotype of overweight/obesity and T2D or high risk for T2D. Spearman rank correlations (ρ) revealed inverse correlations between the glucose infusion rate and several AA/AA metabolites at baseline.
PMC4525767	R00003	As expected, the glucose infusion rate was inversely correlated with the BCAA: leucine (ρ=−0.52, p=0.007), isoleucine (ρ=−0.41, p=0.043), and valine (ρ=−0.51, p=0.010); and AAA: phenylalanine (ρ=−0.70, p=0.007), tyrosine (ρ=−0.55, p=0.005).

PMC4525767	R00013	In contrast, insulin sensitizer therapy increased the plasma serine and glycine concentrations.
PMC4525767	R00015	Moreover, the global rank score was inversely associated with change in glucose infusion rate (ρ =−0.74, p<0.001).
PMC4525767	R00017	Twenty five overweight/obese (BMI~30 kg/m_2 ) adults with impaired fasting glucose or untreated diabetes were randomized to three months of pioglitazone (45 mg per day) plus metformin (1000 mg twice per day, N = 12 participants) or placebo (n=13).
PMC4525767	R00018	Compared to placebo, insulin sensitizer therapy increased fasting plasma concentrations of phenylalanine (A), tyrosine (B), glutamic acid (C), arginine (D), citrulline (E), aspartic acid (F), lysine (G), α-aminoadipic acid (H), and ethanolamine (I).
PMC4525767	R00024	Spearman rank correlations (ρ) between the absolute pre-to-post intervention change in the glucose infusion rate and the absolute pre-to-post intervention changes in the plasma BCAA and AAA in the insulin sensitizer treated group revealed no statistically significant associations.
PMC4525767	R00025	Likewise, the Spearman rank correlations (ρ) between the relative pre-to-post intervention percent change in the glucose infusion rate and the relative pre-to-post intervention percent changes in the plasma BCAA and AAA in the insulin sensitizer treated group revealed also no statistically significant associations.

PMC4534804	A00006	The pharmacokinetics of the most abundant prototype compounds, berberine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine and magnoflorine were determined.
PMC4534804	A00009	Magnoflorine, an aporphine alkaloid, was absorbed better in the Chinese than in the African.
PMC4534804	D00008	The rationale behind this method is that, since compounds in the formulation belong to one of several families such as flavonoid, glycosides, alkaloid, etc., each one has a characteristic carbon skeleton.
PMC4534804	D00015	These were determined as berberine, jatrorrhizine, palmatine and magnoflorine.
PMC4534804	D00024	These ‘conjugation reactions’ also increase the water solubility of a drug molecule with a polar moiety such as acetate, glucuronide or sulphate.
PMC4534804	D00026	The AUC values for the African volunteers were higher than that of the Chinese with respect to the three benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (berberine, jatrorrhizine, and palmatine).
PMC4534804	D00027	Magnoflorine, one of the aporphine alkaloids, performed better in the Chinese volunteers than in the Africans.
PMC4534804	D00029	The T _max  for berberine, jatrorrhizine, and palmatine was 4 hours in the African volunteers corresponding to the results in rat model.
PMC4534804	D00039	These metabolites were found to be from the parent compounds of gallic acid, secologanoside, 4-O -caffeoylquinic acid and its isomers, emodin, lotusine, palmatine, berberine and baicalin.
PMC4534804	D00042	Metabolites of emodin, lotusine, palmatine, berberine were detected in high concentrations.

PMC4562456	A00001	Recent studies suggest that increased innate immune activation and tryptophan catabolism are associated with higher risk of depression in HIV infection and other chronic inflammatory diseases, but the mechanisms leading to depression remain poorly understood.
PMC4562456	A02000	Decreased monoamine metabolites (phenylacetate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate) and acylcarnitines (propionylcarnitine, isobutyrylcarnitine, isovalerylcarnitine, 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine) in plasma distinguished depressed subjects from controls in HIV-positive and HIV-negative cohorts, and these alterations correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms.
PMC4562456	A02001	In HIV-positive subjects, acylcarnitines and other markers of mitochondrial function correlated inversely with tryptophan catabolism, a marker of IFN responses, suggesting inter-relationships between inflammatory pathways, tryptophan catabolism, and metabolic alterations associated with depression.
PMC4562456	A04000	HIV, depression, metabolomics, tryptophan catabolism, monoamines, acylcarnitines
PMC4562456	D00001	While current therapeutics primarily target monamine-related mechanisms (monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors), accumulating evidence suggests non-monoamine mechanisms including alterations in the HPA axis, inflammation, stress responses, and mitochondrial dysfunction may also contribute to MDD.
PMC4562456	D00003	This metabolite set (phenylacetate, 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, propionylcarnitine, isobutyrylcarnitine, isovalerylcarnitine, and 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine) correlated with the severity of depressive symptoms, and mapped to pathways involved in monoamine metabolism, mitochondrial function, and inflammation.
PMC4562456	D00004	Furthermore, correlation analysis identified inter-relationships between IFN responses (IFN-gamma, CXCL10 and CXCL9), kynurenine, and K:T ratio, and metabolites associated with mitochondrial function, suggesting that augmented IFN responses and increased tryptophan catabolism may influence mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of MDD.
PMC4562456	D00005	Together, these results suggest that subtle alterations in the metabolism of monoamines (tryptophan [serotonin], phenylalanine [dopamine], and trace amines) and mitochondrial energetics may contribute to mechanisms involved in the development of MDD, and these processes may be influenced by inflammation during HIV infection.
PMC4562456	D00010	IFN-alpha is thought to contribute to the susceptibility to depression by altering serotonin metabolism, HPA function, and metabolic activity in the basal ganglia [, , ].
PMC4562456	D00011	Consistent with previous studies [, ], depression was associated with decreased tryptophan and increased K:T ratio in two independent cohorts of HIV-infected individuals (with and without ART).
PMC4562456	D00013	Tryptophan is a precursor of serotonin and its bioavailability has been shown to determine the rate of serotonin synthesis in the brain.
PMC4562456	D00014	Tryptophan can also be catabolized via the kynurenine pathway, forming kynurenine derivatives and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), a coenzyme important for energy metabolism.
PMC4562456	D00015	Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), a rate-limiting enzymes for tryptophan catabolism by the kynurenine pathway, is induced by inflammatory cytokines and its activity is enhanced in chronic inflammatory conditions such as atherosclerosis and obesity [, ].
PMC4562456	D00017	While ART has been shown to reduce tryptophan catabolism and improve phenylalanine to tyrosine ratios in HIV-positive individuals, these metabolite alterations persist despite ART [, , -].
PMC4562456	D00018	Furthermore, some kynurenine derivatives are neurotoxic (3-hydroxykynurenine and quinolinic acid) and have been shown to both agonize and antagonize the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which plays an important role in regulating glutamatergic neurotransmission.
PMC4562456	D00019	Thus, increased tryptophan catabolism via the kynurenine pathway may contribute to depression not only by effects on serotonin biosynthesis, but also by production of neurotoxic metabolites and possible effects on the glutamatergic system.
PMC4562456	D00020	Another finding in HIV-positive and negative subjects with depression was decreased phenylacetate and 4-hydroxphenylacetate, products of phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolism derived from oxidation of phenylethylamine and tyramine through the action of MAO.
PMC4562456	D00022	Alterations in phenylalanine metabolism have been reported in older adults with depression and depressed patients with heart failure.
PMC4562456	D00023	Furthermore, decreased phenylacetate in urine was proposed as a biomarker of some forms of unipolar depression [, ].
PMC4562456	D00024	Decreased dopamine (and its metabolites) and increased MAO activity have been reported in the basal ganglia of SIV-infected macaques and HIV patients with neurological disease [-]; these alterations also correlated with neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.
PMC4562456	D00026	Plasma metabolomics also revealed decreased acylcarnitines (propionylcarnitine, isobutyrylcarnitine, isovalerylcarnitine, and 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine) in HIV-positive and negative subjects with depression, a finding that correlated with severity of depression.
PMC4562456	D00027	Acylcarnitines are fatty acyl esters of L-carnitine that facilitate entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria for ATP synthesis.
PMC4562456	D00028	Acylcarnitine supplementation was shown to have beneficial effects in treatment of certain neurological diseases, and brain acylcarnitines have been shown to have neuroprotective effects, stabilizing membrane composition, modulating neurotransmission, protecting against excitotoxicity, and having antioxidant and anti-apototic functions (reviewed in).
PMC4562456	D00029	Alterations in acylcarnitine levels are used to diagnose genetic defects in mitochondrial β-oxidation [-].
PMC4562456	D00030	Several studies found evidence of altered mitochondrial function [, ] or decreased ATP production and alterations in respiratory chain enzymes in muscle from patients with lifetime diagnosis of MDD.
PMC4562456	D00032	In the current study, acylcarnitines correlated with the BCAA catabolites 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate and 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate.
PMC4562456	D00034	Furthermore, 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate is often used to assess liver mitochondrial function and can influence glutamate synthesis in neurons [, ].
PMC4562456	D00047	In summary, metabolomics identified altered monoamine and acylcarnitine metabolites, along with increased inflammatory markers in HIV-positive and HIV-negative subjects with depression compared to non-depressed controls, suggesting inter-relationships between inflammation, altered monoamine metabolism (serotonin, dopamine, trace amines) and mitochondrial energetics may be involved in the biological mechanisms underlying depression.
PMC4562456	R00003	Two subjects were being treated for diabetes, 6 for high cholesterol, and 24 for high blood pressure.
PMC4562456	R00004	HIV-positive subjects in the test cohort had late stage disease (nadir CD4<300 cells/ul) and were on ART (77% on protease inhibitors (PI), 22% on d-drugs associated with mitochondrial toxicity [e.g., stavudine and didanosine]) with suppressed plasma viral loads (<400 copies/ml).
PMC4562456	R01003	32% (74/229) of metabolites mapped to biologically relevant pathways, including phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolites (metabolism of dopamine and other monoamines), tryptophan metabolites (serotonin synthesis), and markers of mitochondrial function (acylcarnitines, TCA components, branched chain amino acid metabolites (BCAA)) and oxidative stress (glutathione and purine metabolites).
PMC4562456	R02002	Evaluating inter-relationships between these metabolites identified a cluster of 5 metabolites that correlated positively in pair-wise comparisons including metabolites related to phenylalanine/tyrosine catabolism (phenylacetate and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate, which are derived from degradation of the biogenic amines phenylethylamine and tyramine, respectively, by monoamine oxidase) and acylcarnitines (isovalerylcarnitine, isobutyrylcarnitine, and propionylcarnitine).
PMC4562456	R02003	CES-D correlated negatively with isovalerylcarnitine, isobutyrylcarnitine, and propionylcarnitine in the HIV-positive validation cohort and negatively with phenylacetate and isobutyrylcarnitine in the HIV-negative cohort (p<0.05, Spearman correlation).
PMC4562456	R03000	Accumulating evidence suggests that inflammation and tryptophan catabolism contribute to mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of depression [, ].
PMC4562456	R03001	Next, we examined alterations in inflammatory cytokines (IL-1-beta, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, CCL2, CXCL8, CXCL9, CXCL10, IFN-alpha, and IFN-gamma), tryptophan and kynurenine levels, and kynurenine to tryptophan ratio (K:T ratio) in HIV-positive and -negative subjects with and without depressive symptoms across test (n=22) and validation cohorts (n=18).
PMC4562456	R03004	Tryptophan and K:T ratio were altered across both test and validation cohorts (p<0.05, ).
PMC4562456	R03007	Evaluating inter-relationships between tryptophan catabolism and inflammation markers in the merged HIV dataset (n=40 subjects) identified strong associations between kynurenine and the IFN-gamma-induced chemokines CXCL9 and CXCL10 (p<0.05, FDR<10%).
PMC4562456	R03008	In contrast, tryptophan levels and K:T ratio were associated with metabolite alterations indicative of altered mitochondrial function (isovaleryl carnitine, propionylcarnitine, 3-methyl-3-oxovalerate, 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate), including two acylcarnitine metabolites associated with depression across independent cohorts ( and ).
PMC4562456	R03009	These results suggest that augmented tryptophan catabolism, a marker of IFN responses, may influence biochemical alterations associated with depression.
PMC4562456	R03011	Beeswarm plots of tryptophan catabolism metabolites and inflammation markers altered in HIV patients with (n=20, red) vs. without depressive symptoms (n=20, blue) from the merged HIV dataset (n=40, age<50 years old).

PMC4562456	R04000	Next, we examined inter-relationships between plasma metabolites, depression scores, and tryptophan catabolism (tryptophan and K:T ratio) in the HIV-positive test and validation cohorts.
PMC4562456	R04002	In cluster 1, tryptophan, 3-methyl-2-oxovalerate, and 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate (BCAA catabolites associated with mitochondrial dysfunction) correlated negatively with K:T ratio.
PMC4562456	R04003	In cluster 2, acylcarnitines (propionylcarnitine, isovalerylcarnitine, isobutyrylcarnitine, 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine), phenylacetate, and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate correlated positively with tryptophan and BCAA catabolites, and negatively with severity of depression (depression scores [BDI or CES-D]).
PMC4562456	R04005	Mapping these inter-related metabolites to metabolic pathways (KEGG and SMPDB) and bio-functions (HMDB) identified alterations in pathways involved in monoamine metabolism (phenylalanine and tyrosine metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, serotonin biosynthesis, dopamine synthesis, and catecholamine synthesis), mitochondrial function and energy production (TCA cycle, Nicotinamide and NAD+ synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, BCAA metabolism), and immune function and inflammation (tryptophan metabolism).

PMC4582777	M02006	After overnight incubation at 37°C (~18 hours), the target analytes were extracted with a 20% toluene 80% pentane solvent mix (v/v) through automated LLE on a Gilson 215 liquid handler as described elsewhere.
PMC4582777	M02007	In brief, de-ionized water (2 mL) and pentane/toluene mix (5 mL) were added to the urine and the samples were mixed by rotation for 5 min (20 rpm) using the automatic liquid handler.
PMC4582777	M02010	This extraction procedure was repeated with additional pentane/toluene mix volume (5 mL).
PMC4582777	M02011	The combined pentane/toluene extracts were spiked with dodecane (10 μL) as a keeper, and concentrated on a RapidVap vacuum evaporator (Labconco Corporation, Kansas City, MO, USA), first at 40°C, 40% vortex speed and 500 mbar vacuum for 10 min to evaporate pentane, then at 70°C, 50% speed and 230 mbar to evaporate toluene until ~10 μL remained (20 min).

PMC4582777	M04002	This pool was then divided and spiked with a standard mixture containing the target analytes in acetonitrile at two different levels to create two QC pools: low QC (spiked with 200 pg/mL) and high QC (spiked with 700 pg/mL).
PMC4582777	R00000	We developed a method to quantify 11 hydroxylated metabolites of 1-MeN and 2-MeN, along with 10 OH-PAHs, metabolites of 4 un-substituted PAHs, in human urine using automated LLE and isotope dilution GC-MS/MS determination.
PMC4582777	R00001	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an analytical method for measuring MeN metabolites in human urine and first report of their concentrations in urine samples.
PMC4582777	R00002	As expected, the Me-OHNs eluted shortly after the naphthols and before the hydroxyfluorenes.
PMC4582777	R00003	Although analytically this method could measure five additional compounds (1-methyl-2-naphthol, 2-methyl-1-naphthol, 8-methyl-1-naphthol, 9-hydroxyphenanthrene, 3-hydroxyfluoranthene), as shown in , these compounds were not reported because of their instability and unstable QC curves, which rendered them inadequate as exposure biomarkers.
PMC4582777	R00005	Peaks represent the trimethylsilyl ethers of OH-PAHs and Me-OHNs.
PMC4582777	R01001	On a ZB-5MS 5% phenyl methyl silicone column, the 14 Me-OHNs eluted as 8 distinct chromatographic peaks with each peak representing 1–3 isomers.
PMC4582777	R01005	(Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA), a polar column with its stationary phase consisting of 90% biscyanopropyl/10% cyanopropylphenyl polysiloxane, yielded the best separation in which the 14 Me-OHNs were eluted as 11 chromatographic peaks.
PMC4582777	R01008	This led to broadened peak shape and reduced sensitivity for the late eluting analytes such as 1-PYR.
PMC4582777	R01010	Such combined concentrations should provide a better estimation of MeN exposure than individual concentrations because 1-MeN and 2-MeN are both present in pyrogenic and petrogenic sources and both lead to multiple metabolites.
PMC4582777	R01011	However, for certain applications, such as to assess accidental exposure to specific MeNs, the RTX-2330 column would provide a better separation of Me-OHN metabolites than the ZB-5MS column and thus facilitate the exposure assessment to 1-MeN or 2-MeN separately.
PMC4582777	R01014	During the method validation, a partially co-eluting interference affecting 4-hydroxyphenanthrene was present in certain urine samples.
PMC4582777	R02000	Like the OH-PAH metabolites, preliminary data suggest that the Me-OHNs are excreted in urine predominantly as conjugates (data not shown).

PMC4582777	R02005	However, when we conducted deconjugation experiments on the Me-OHNs, concentrations of several Me-OHNs, such as 4-methyl-1-naphthol (4M1N), decreased up to 50% during the overnight hydrolysis.
PMC4582777	R02007	After excluding glass binding and photodegradation (data not shown), we tested ascorbic acid as an antioxidant to prevent potential degradation by hydroxyl and superoxide radicals [–], and found that ascorbic acid effectively stabilized the Me-OHNs during the hydrolysis process by preventing the oxidation of the deconjugated Me-OHNs.
PMC4582777	R02008	We further determined 2.5 mg ascorbic acid per 1 mL urine as the appropriate amount to ensure that all Me-OHNs were stable during the enzymatic hydrolysis.
PMC4582777	R02009	Calculated concentrations of selected methyl naphthols in a smoker’s urine sample as a function of deconjugation time for 5 different amounts of ascorbic acid (AA, mg/mL urine)
PMC4582777	R03000	In addition to the inclusion of Me-OHNs, the current method improved the quantification of urinary OH-PAHs, including 1-PYR, compared to the previous method.
PMC4582777	R03004	The recoveries were 52% and 53% for the two _13 C-naphthols and 69–100% for the eight larger _13 C-OH-PAH internal standards, compared to 46–72% in the previous method.
PMC4582777	R03007	Finally, the presence of ascorbic acid facilitated the deconjugation of several OH-PAH conjugates, i.e., those of 1-naphthol and 9-hydroxyfluorene.
PMC4582777	R03008	The hydrolysis of these conjugates was inefficient compared to other OH-PAHs, potentially due to steric hindrance and higher composition of sulfate conjugate.
PMC4582777	R03009	In addition, 9-FLU is an alcohol rather than a phenol, which might affect the deconjugation efficiency.
PMC4582777	R03010	The use of ascorbic acid increased the deconjugation speed, most likely by preventing the oxidative damage of β-glucuronidase and sulfatase, and thus reduced deconjugation time required to achieve maximal yield from overnight to 3 hour.
PMC4582777	R03012	Our previous analytical method targeted 24 urinary OH-PAHs, namely the 10 OH-PAHs reported in this method and monohydroxyl derivatives of BaP, chrysene, benz(a)anthracene and benzo(c)phenanthrene, including 3-hydroxybenzo[a ]pyrene (3-BaP, LOD: 2.6 ng/L), a metabolite of BaP.
PMC4582777	R03015	For example, 3-BaP had a detection rate of 0% in all demographic groups in the Canadian Health Measures Survey (LOD: 2 ng/L).
PMC4582777	R03016	With a more sensitive method (LOD: 0.1 ng/L), Lafontaine et al. detected 3-BaP in 18.5% of non-smokers and 66.7% of smokers (13–50 cigarettes/day), and acknowledged nonetheless that the use of 3-BaP as PAH exposure biomarker was less justified.
PMC4582777	R03017	To avoid miss-interpretation during exposure assessment, we discontinued the measurement of monohydroxyl derivatives of the larger PAHs, including 3-BaP, and reported 10 detectable and stable urinary OH-PAHs, i.e. metabolites of naphthalene, fluorene, phenanthrene and pyrene, in this method and in all recent research projects [, ].
PMC4582777	R04001	Because OH-PAHs and Me-OHNs are ubiquitous contaminants in urine, we spiked synthetic urine with 4 different levels of standard mixtures (10, 20, 50 and 100 pg/mL; 40–400 pg/mL for 1- & 2-NAP) and performed 6 repeated measurements to determine the SD at each level.
PMC4582777	R04003	The method detection limits were 7.0–41 pg/mL for the Me-OHNs and 1.0–19 pg/mL for the OH-PAHs.
PMC4582777	R04005	The overall coefficients of variance (CVs) from 30 runs of QCL and QCH over a 3-month period, shown in , were 4.7–8.3% for most OH-PAHs, except for 3-hydroxyphenanthrene (13%).
PMC4582777	R04007	For the Me-OHNs, the CVs were 11–19%, higher than those of OH-PAHs, likely because only one _13 C-IS is available for the Me-OHNs.
PMC4582777	R04016	Mean OH-PAH and Me-OHN urinary concentrations in pg/mL (standard deviation and coefficients of variation from 4 repeated measurements) in Standard Reference Materials (SRMs).
PMC4582777	R05002	For example, the GM concentrations of 1-PYR, the most commonly used PAH exposure biomarker, were 58 and 482 ng/L in the non-smoker and smoker samples, respectively, corresponding to 8.3 fold difference between these two groups.
PMC4582777	R05003	Me-OHNs were detected in 53–97% of non-smokers and 100% of smokers.
PMC4582777	R05004	As shown in , the geometric mean concentrations for Me-OHNs ranged from 34–453 pg/mL in the non-smokers to 1,608–6,990 pg/mL in the smokers, which corresponds to an average of 36.7 (range: 9.9–61) fold difference.
PMC4582777	R05007	Interestingly, the concentration differences between smokers and non-smokers of Me-OHNs are even higher than those of OH-PAHs, the commonly recognized PAH exposure biomarkers.
PMC4582777	R05008	In the 30 non-smokers, the GM urinary concentrations of MeN metabolites (sum of 11 Me-OHNs; 1.7 ng/mL) were lower than those of the naphthalene metabolites (sum of 1- and 2-naphthol; 5.8 ng/mL).
PMC4582777	R05009	In the 30 smokers, the GM concentrations of the metabolites from naphthalene and MeNs were comparable, at 33.7 and 33.4 ng/mL, respectively.
PMC4582777	R05010	Similarly, the Me-OHN concentrations were 10.9–30.0 times higher in the NIST smoker urine SRM than the non-smoker urine SRM, while for the OH-PAHs, the differences were smaller (0.2–11.0 fold).
PMC4582777	R05011	These results were consistent with the report that a higher amount of methyl PAHs, such as MeNs, were generated in tobacco smoking compared to other combustion sources [, ], and strongly suggested the utility of urinary Me-OHNs as biomarkers to assess human exposure to MeNs.

PMC4624446	M00001	Venous blood was drawn into a tube containing heparin, chilled on ice, and centrifuged within an hour.
PMC4624446	M00004	Samples that were used directly were diluted with 300 μL solution containing 250 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mM formate and 10% D_2 O. Ultrafiltration was performed using Millipore centrifugal devices (Millipore Microcon YM-10) with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff.
PMC4624446	M00005	Human plasma (300 μL) was diluted with 300 μL solution containing 250 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), 5 mM formate and 10% D_2 O and centrifuged at 14,000g and 277 K for up to 3 h.
PMC4624446	M00006	To reduce glycerol (membrane preservative) contamination of the filtrate, all centrifugal devices were washed four times (by 30 min of centrifugation at 10,000g) with 500 μL water immediately prior to usage.
PMC4624446	M01007	Prior to spectral fitting manual chemical referencing of formate at 8.444 ppm was performed.
PMC4624446	M02016	The spectral basis set consisted of 28 previously identified metabolites and included 2-hydroxy-butyrate (CHEBI:64552), 3-hydroxy-butyrate (CHEBI:37054), acetate (CHEBI:30089), acetoacetate (CHEBI:13705), acetone (CHEBI:15347), alanine (CHEBI:16449), arginine (CHEBI:29016), betaine (CHEBI:22860), carnitine (CHEBI:17126), choline (CHEBI:15354), citrate (CHEBI:53258), creatine (CHEBI:16919), creatinine (CHEBI:16737), ethanol (CHEBI:16236), glucose (CHEBI:17234), glutamate (CHEBI:64243), glutamine (CHEBI:28300), isoleucine (CHEBI:17191), lactate (CHEBI:75228), leucine (CHEBI:25017), lysine (CHEBI:18019), methionine (CHEBI:16811), ornithine (CHEBI:18257), proline (CHEBI:26271), pyruvate (CHEBI:15361), succinate (CHEBI:63675), threonine (CHEBI:16857) and valine (CHEBI:27266).
PMC4624446	R00012	The signal of β-H2 glucose at 3.23 ppm was used to normalize both _1 H NMR spectra.
PMC4624446	R00016	The signals from ethanol represent a contamination accidently introduced by the incomplete drying of reused NMR tubes following a cleaning with water and ethanol.
PMC4624446	R00017	Ethanol was excluded from the correlation coefficient calculation.
PMC4624446	R00020	For all samples the β-H2 glucose signal at 3.23 ppm was referenced to the glucose concentration measured with a glucometer.
PMC4624446	R00029	Recently the use of protein precipitation with methanol was evaluated as an attractive and reliable alternative to ultrafiltration for NMR-based metabolomics.
PMC4629114	A01017	Significant differences have been detected of metabolites such as glutamate, pyruvate and lactate_, as well as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and poly creatine kinase (PCR).These findings indicate that changes in the systemic peripheral chemical environment may also have an impact on central mechanisms.
PMC4629114	D00002	Although, cholesterol, inosine and threonic acid showed changes with a similar correlation structure in both NP and CWP and arginine and aminomalonic acid showed the opposite correlation structure.
PMC4629114	D00011	In the present study, cholesterol, inosine and threonic acid showed changes with a similar correlation structure in both the NP and CWP groups.
PMC4629114	D00012	In the univariate analysis, cholesterols and threonic acid showed a significantly lower abundance when comparing both healthy controls to CWP and NP and inosine only to NP.
PMC4629114	D00013	Arginine and aminomalonic acid displayed opposite correlation structures with a higher abundance in CWP.
PMC4629114	D00017	Several amino acids, cysteine, serine, asparagine, arginine, orthinine, tyrosine and taurine, showed an increased abundance in the CON group as compared to the NP group and only valine, an increased abundance in the NP group.
PMC4629114	D00019	However, cysteine with its thiol side chain has important antioxidant properties and together with glutamic acid (increased in the CON group) and glycine are the constituents of the antioxidant glutathione.
PMC4629114	D00020	Glutathione is oxidised to glutathione disulfide and reduced back using nicotinamide-adenine-dinucleotidephosphate (NADPH).
PMC4629114	D00021	Arginine and orthinine are both involved in the NADPH-dependent synthesis of nitric oxide.
PMC4629114	D00022	The role of nitric oxide in pain conditions is not clear with both nociceptive and analgesic effects peripherally and centrally (for review, see).
PMC4629114	D00023	The main source of NADPH is the pentose phosphate pathway and the only metabolite identified in that pathway, erythrose-4-phosphate, showed an increased abundance in the CON group as compared to the NP group.
PMC4629114	D00024	In addition, α−tocopherol and threonic acid a metabolite of the antioxidant vitamin C, displayed an increased abundance in CON compared to NP.
PMC4629114	D00026	One prominent difference between NP and CON is the lower abundance of cholesterol in the NP group.
PMC4629114	D00027	This difference between groups could be due to several mechanisms, including difference in intestinal absorption efficiency, biliary excretion and or synthesis of cholesterol though the mevalonate pathway.
PMC4629114	D00029	(2000) showed, in a study on 32 patients with myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) and 30 patients with FM syndrome, an increased total serum cholesterol levels in the MPS group compared to the age-matched healthy controls but no difference in comparison to the FM group.
PMC4629114	D00032	Several studies have related an increased serum level of cholesterol to work-related tendon disorders, for example in frozen shoulder and rotator cuff tear.
PMC4629114	D00036	However, it must be emphasised that the mechanisms by which cholesterol could be lower are not clear in subjects with muscle pain.
PMC4629114	D00037	In a speculation, a reduced cholesterol level in NP may arise from a reduced cholesterol synthesis by HMG-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway.
PMC4629114	D00038	A change in the mevalonate pathway reducing cholesterol synthesis, would also predict a reduction of other substances depending on the same pathway, like testosterone and ubiquinone (coenzyme Q_10 ).
PMC4629114	D00039	Ubiquinone is an antioxidant and essential component of the oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondrial inner membrane.
PMC4629114	D00040	Lowered testosterone levels have been found in women suffering from clinically verified neck or shoulder pain disorders.
PMC4629114	D00041	To the authors knowledge no study have investigate the levels of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q_10 ) in people suffering from neck pain.
PMC4629114	D00042	The methodology used did not enable analysis of ubiquinone, although there was an increased abundance of succinate in NP.
PMC4629114	D00043	Accumulation of succinate occurs if the function of the redox process (i.e. transfer of electrons) in complex II is limited or if the activity or expression of succinate dehydrogenase is down-regulated.
PMC4629114	D00044	In short, ubiquinone accepts electrons transferred from succinate by succinate dehydrogenase (complex II).
PMC4629114	D00045	In this process, succinate is oxidised to fumarate and ubiquinone is reduced to ubiquinol.
PMC4629114	D00046	Ubiquinol then delivers the electrons to complex III in the oxidative phosphorylation and is subsequently reoxidised to ubiquinone.
PMC4629114	D00047	A reduced production of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q_10 ) could impair oxidative phosphorylation.
PMC4629114	D00048	Impaired oxidative phosphorylation has been proposed as one mechanism behind the adverse myalgia reported for cholesterol lowering pharmaceutical such as statins.
PMC4629114	D00049	The NP group showed an increased abundance in saturated fatty acids, myristic acid, nonanoic acid, palmitic acid, as well as in unsaturated fatty acids, gondoic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid and arachidonic acid.
PMC4629114	D00050	The saturated fatty acids myristic and palmatic acids were also evident in the muscle interstitium of the myalgic muscle.
PMC4629114	D00052	The increased abundance of carbohydrate metabolites coincides with previously presented results of a reduction in glucose uptake in muscles in persons suffering NP compared to the muscles healthy controls.
PMC4629114	D00053	In general, excess carbohydrate is converted to fatty acids, initially palmitic acid, mostly in the liver.
PMC4629114	D00054	A metabolite in the intersection of the glycolysis, fatty acid metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation is glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P), which showed a higher abundance in the CON group.
PMC4629114	D00055	Also Adenosine-5-monophosphate (AMP) was more abundant in the NP-group according to the CON-NP OPLS-DA model and the univariate statistics.
PMC4629114	D00056	However, the implications of systemic differences of G3P and AMP for muscle pain are unclear.
PMC4629114	D00057	Several unsaturated and saturated fatty acids are also precursor for synthesis of bioactive fatty acid amides related to inflammation and pain like N-acylethanolamines, including endocannabinoids.
PMC4629114	D00058	Intra-muscular levels of N-acylethanolamines have been shown to correlate with pain intensity and sensitivity in women both with CWP and NP.
PMC4629114	D00059	In the present study, there was an increased abundance of taurine in the CON.
PMC4629114	D00060	Taurine, a sulphur-containing b-amino acid, is the most abundant amino acid in the body, with high concentrations in skeletal and heart muscle.
PMC4629114	D00061	The main source of taurine in humans is from diet, with endogenous synthesis from cysteine and methionine in presence of vitamin B_6 being relatively small.
PMC4629114	D00062	Taurine is involved in stress responses integrity of cell membranes and protein stabilisation (for review, see) and interacts with the glutamate and GABA glucinergic system.
PMC4629114	D00063	Knock-out mice with taurine deficiency have been shown to have a reduced sensitivity to nociceptive chemical stimuli, showing an effect of the peripheral nervous system.
PMC4629114	D00064	In this study, the NP group had less taurine in the blood stream compared to the healthy group and the CWP group, implying a potential correlation to pain perception.
PMC4629114	D00071	Dietary intake of phytosterols, like campesterol and β–sitosterol, competitively reduces the cholesterol intestinal absorption efficiency and could potentially account for the observed difference in cholesterol.
PMC4629114	D00072	In the present study, campesterol but not β–sitosterol showed a significant difference between the NP and CON groups.
PMC4629114	D00074	However, the significance of the groups difference in campesterol should be interpreted with caution: campesterol measured in plasma is not a suitable marker for dietary phytosterol uptake since the uptake mechanism is highly complex and not only dependent on intestinal concentrations.
PMC4629114	D00075	Observations from diet intervention studies also suggest a large intra individual variation in phytosterol uptake.
PMC4629114	D00081	Further, the suggested mechanism of paracetamol concerns more central pain mechanisms in combination with a weak anti-inflammatory effect.
PMC4629114	M02006	All participants were asked not to use any pain medications except for paracetamol preparations for three days before the day of the experiment.
PMC4629114	M02007	Also, the subjects were asked to refrain from intake of caffeine, nicotine and wholegrains 12 h prior to the blood sample being collected and only to drink water in the last 2 h.
PMC4629114	M04005	Methoxymation with 30 μl methoxyamine solution in pyridine (15 μg/μl) was carried out at RT for 1 h, after whi h 30 μl of heptanes (with 0.5 μg of methyl stearate as injection IS) were added_, .
PMC4629114	M05001	The following were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, (Andover, MA, USA): stable isotope labelled IS compound 13C5-proline, 2H4-succinic acid, 13C5, 15 N-glutamic acid, 1,2,3-13C3 myristic acid, 2H7-cholesterol and 13C4 disodium alpha-ketoglutarate.

PMC4629114	M05005	Metyl stearate was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA).
PMC4629114	M05006	N-Metyl-N-trimethylsilyltriflouroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) and pyridine (silylation grade) were purchased from Pierce Chemical Co, Dallas,TX, USA).
PMC4629114	M05007	Heptane was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK).
PMC4629114	M08011	In addition, the meals were classified according to if the subject reported eating nuts, whole grain, fresh vegetables or any other phytosterol rich food or not.
PMC4629114	R00001	There was no significant difference between groups when considering subject characteristics such as age, weight, body mass index (BMI), pain ratings at the time of blood sampling (NP and CWP groups only) and nicotine use.
PMC4629114	R00005	No significant differences were detected between NP and CON or CWP and CON concerning self-reported frequency of intake of phytosterol rich food (Fischer exact, p = 0.411) 8 hours before blood samples were taken.
PMC4629114	R00007	Data with median (range) for all variables and groups apart from the number of nicotine users, which is presented as the number (percent in group).
PMC4629114	R02001	shows the identified metabolites related to the CON in the CON–NP model, mainly amino acids and cholesterol but also glycerol-3-phosphate, α-tocopherol (vitamin E with anti-oxidative properties) and threonic acid (vitamin C metabolite).
PMC4629114	R02007	Only cholesterol, threonic acid and inosine show a lower abundance in both NP and CWP while arginine and aminomalonic acid show increased abundance in CWP and a lower in NP.
PMC4709190	A00000	The microbial metabolite Trimethylamine-N -oxide (TMAO) has been linked to adverse cardiovascular outcome and mortality in the general population.
PMC4709190	A01000	To assess the contribution of TMAO to inflammation and mortality in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients ranging from mild-moderate to end-stage disease and 1) associations with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 2) effect of dialysis and renal transplantation (Rtx) 3) association with inflammatory biomarkers and 4) its predictive value for all-cause mortality.
PMC4709190	A03000	GFR was the dominant variable affecting TMAO (β = -0.41; p<0.001), choline (β = -0.38; p<0.001), and betaine (β = 0.45; p<0.001) levels.
PMC4709190	A03001	A longitudinal study of 74 CKD 5 patients starting renal replacement therapy demonstrated that whereas dialysis treatment did not affect TMAO, Rtx reduced levels of TMAO to that of controls (p<0.001).
PMC4709190	A03002	Following Rtx choline and betaine levels continued to increase.
PMC4709190	A03003	In CKD 3–5, TMAO levels were associated with IL-6 (Rho = 0.42; p<0.0001), fibrinogen (Rho = 0.43; p<0.0001) and hsCRP
PMC4709190	A03005	Higher TMAO levels were associated with an increased risk for all-cause mortality that remained significant after multivariate adjustment (HR 4.32, 95% CI 1.32–14.2; p = 0.016).
PMC4709190	A04000	Elevated TMAO levels are strongly associated with degree of renal function in CKD and normalize after renal transplantation.
PMC4709190	A04001	TMAO levels correlates with increased systemic inflammation and is an independent predictor of mortality in CKD 3–5 patients.
PMC4709190	D00000	The present study show that impaired renal function is a major determinant of plasma levels of TMAO in CKD.
PMC4709190	D00001	Moreover, TMAO levels were associated with increased levels of systemic inflammatory biomarkers, but the association was lost when controlling for mGFR.
PMC4709190	D00002	Finally, high levels of TMAO predicted reduced 5-year survival that remained significant after multivariate adjustment.
PMC4709190	D00003	The finding that TMAO levels are elevated in CKD and inversely associate with GFR has been observed in several studies [, , , , ].
PMC4709190	D00004	The observation that TMAO levels decline rapidly after Rtx and remain low after two years corroborates recent findings in 6 patients by Stubbs et al .
PMC4709190	D00005	However, the distribution and inflammatory associations of the TMAO precursors, choline and betaine in CKD have not been previously described.
PMC4709190	D00006	Our results suggest that dietary recommendations may affect levels of choline and betaine in CKD but have less impact on TMAO levels.
PMC4709190	D00007	A protein-restricted diet -commonly prescribed to CKD 3–5 patients—corresponds with the unchanged choline and decreasing betaine levels observed with each CKD stage.
PMC4709190	D00008	Notably, levels of choline and betaine increased after 12 months of dialysis, which may reflect guideline recommendations of increased protein intake for dialysis patients.
PMC4709190	D00009	These presumably dietary related changes did not, however, result in the corresponding increases in TMAO levels that have been shown in previous studies [, ].
PMC4709190	D00011	It is intriguing that whereas Rtx dramatically reduced TMAO to control levels, choline and betaine levels increased even further.
PMC4709190	D00012	Based on these observations we draw two conclusions: First, dietary changes could not explain the normalized levels of TMAO after Rtx, since levels of the TMAO precursors, betaine and choline, increased.
PMC4709190	D00013	Second, the reduction of TMAO levels after Rtx, reinforce that decreased renal clearance is the major cause of elevated TMAO levels in the uremic milieu.
PMC4709190	D00014	Interestingly, and in contrast to previous studies, we found strong associations between TMAO and inflammatory biomarkers.
PMC4709190	D00015	We also observed similar but inverse associations for betaine and inflammatory biomarkers.
PMC4709190	D00016	In accordance, Troseid et al . reported that whereas increased LPS levels in 155 patients with chronic heart failure did not associate with TMAO or choline it was inversely associated with betaine levels.
PMC4709190	D00017	In contrast Srinivasa et al studied TMAO, choline and betaine in HIV patients and reported no association with IL-6, hsCRP or LPS.
PMC4709190	D00019	Tang et al . found no association between TMAO and hsCRP in 521 CKD 3 patients, whereas Kaysen et al . reported a paradoxical inverse association between TMAO and hsCRP in 235 prevalent HD patients.
PMC4709190	D00023	On the other hand, differences in TMAO metabolism and inflammation between prevalent dialysis patients and CKD 5 patients not yet on dialysis treatment as in our study could explain the different outcome reported by Kaysen et al ..
PMC4709190	D00024	Although the significant associations between TMAO and inflammatory markers were lost when renal function was accounted for, suggesting that TMAO might be a surrogate marker for GFR, we cannot exclude that TMAO may have direct proinflammatory and even nephrotoxic properties.
PMC4709190	D00025	Tang et al . demonstrated that dietary induced TMAO elevation directly contributed to progressive renal fibrosis and dysfunction in mice.
PMC4709190	D00026	In further support of this notion, a metabolite profiling of participants in the Framingham Heart Study, identified plasma TMAO and choline as markers predicative of CKD at 8 years follow-up that were not correlated with baseline eGFR.
PMC4709190	D00027	In accordance with previous studies on patients with CVD [, ], heart failure [, ] and CKD [, ] we found that raised TMAO levels predicted a higher 5-year mortality rate.
PMC4709190	D00028	The significant association between TMAO and outcome remained after multivariate adjustments, suggesting that TMAO may be an independent risk factor for mortality in CKD 3–5.
PMC4709190	D00033	The present study has several strengths: i) it is the first study presenting an in-depth analysis of relations between renal function and TMAO levels, and its dietary precursors, in two groups of well-defined and extensively characterized patients with CKD ranging from mild-moderate (CKD 3–4) to advanced (CKD 5) stage; ii) it presents longitudinal data on the interventional effects of dialysis and Rtx on TMAO levels in CKD 5 patients; iii) the CKD 3–4 and CKD 5 cohorts were relatively homogeneous in terms of age, sex, and etiology of CKD, which lends additional credibility to our results; iv) we also had access to a control group of age and sex-matched, but otherwise randomly selected individuals from a community-based population.
PMC4709190	D00035	In summary, we report that elevated TMAO levels are strongly associated with degree of renal function in CKD and normalize after Rtx.
PMC4709190	D00036	TMAO levels correlates with increased systemic inflammation and is an independent predictor of mortality in this cohort of CKD 3–5 patients.
PMC4709190	M00000	Fasting plasma samples from CKD 3–4 and CKD 5 patients, consecutively recruited into two observational prospective cohort studies previously described [, , ], at Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, were analyzed for TMAO, choline, betaine and systemic markers of inflammation, metabolism and renal function.
PMC4709190	M02000	Plasma heparin samples were obtained after a 12 h fast and stored at -80°C.
PMC4709190	M02001	Quantification of TMAO, choline and betaine was performed by LC-MS/MS, utilizing a protocol designed specifically for this purpose and prepared in a 96-well format.
PMC4709190	M02002	Extracted plasma aliquots were spiked with internal standards, comprised of TMAO-D_9 in methanol and water with Proline-_13 C_5 as a recovery standard, and injected on an Agilent 1290 Infinity chromatographic system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) fitted with an Acquity UPLC Amide column in combination with a VanGuard precolumn (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA).
PMC4709190	M02004	Data processing was performed with MassHunter Quantitative Analysis QQQ (Agilent Technologies Inc. Santa Clara, CA, USA).The MS/MS analysis for TMAO, choline, betaine, TMAO- D_9 and Proline-_13 C_5, were conducted in multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mode at m/z 76→58, m/z 104→45, m/z 118→58, m/z 85→66 and m
PMC4709190	M02006	The TMAO assay was linear up to 0.25 ng injected on column.
PMC4709190	M02008	Metabolite levels remained stable and comparable in assessment of plasma heparin and serum samples and multiple number of freeze-thaw cycles.
PMC4709190	M03002	Circulating levels of albumin, creatinine, calcium, phosphatase, hemoglobin, fibrinogen and hsCRP were analyzed according to certified methods at the Karolinska University Laboratory, Unit of Clinical Chemistry, Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden.
PMC4709190	M03003	Measured GFR (mGFR), which represents a more accurate estimation of renal function, was measured by Iohexol clearance in controls and CKD 3–4 patients.
PMC4709190	M03004	In CKD 5 patients, mGFR was calculated by the mean of renal urea and creatinine clearance from a 24-hour urine collection.
PMC4709190	M03005	Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) used in follow-up after Rtx was calculated by a cystatin C-based equation for estimation of GFR; 130 x cystatin C -1,069 x age -0,117–7, as described previously.
PMC4709190	M04006	We used multiple linear regression analysis to assess determinants of TMAO, choline and betaine levels (adjusting for age, gender, SGA, albumin, DM and mGFR) and inflammation (adjusting for age, gender, smoking, mGFR and metabolites).
PMC4709190	R00002	As expected, CKD 5 patients had a higher burden of comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, CVD and PEW, lower mGFR, plasma albumin and hemoglobin levels and higher levels of creatinine, hsCRP and IL-6, compared with CKD 3–4 patients and controls.
PMC4709190	R01000	CKD patients had higher TMAO levels than controls and the levels rose with decreasing renal function.
PMC4709190	R01001	Consequently, CKD 5 patients had a 13-fold increase in TMAO compared to controls.
PMC4709190	R01002	Levels of choline did not differ significantly between CKD stages and controls.
PMC4709190	R01003	In contrast, betaine levels decreased with each CKD stage and CKD 5 patients had 4-fold lower level of betaine compared to controls.
PMC4709190	R01006	In CKD 3–4 patients, levels of TMAO (Rho = -0.15; p<0.0001) and choline (Rho = -0.31; p = 0.023) correlated inversely with mGFR, whereas betaine correlated with higher mGFR
PMC4709190	R01008	In CKD 5 patients, TMAO exhibited a similar trend (Rho = -0.20; p = 0.062), whereas the association was lost for the other metabolites, possibly due to the narrow range of mGFR in this group of patients.
PMC4709190	R01009	When analyzing the total CKD cohort (CKD 3–5, n = 179), TMAO (Rho = -0.69; p<0.0001) and choline (Rho = -0.32; p<0.0001) demonstrated a robust inverse correlation with mGFR, whereas betaine (Rho = 0.58; p<0.0001) correlated positively with mGFR.
PMC4709190	R01010	In multiple regression analysis of potential determinants for the metabolites, chosen to reflect nutritional status (SGA>1, plasma albumin), DM and renal function in the total CKD cohort, mGFR was the most dominant variable for TMAO (β = -0.41, p<0.001), choline (β = -0.38, p<0.001), and betaine (β = 0.45, p<0.001) levels, respectively.
PMC4709190	R02001	Whereas baseline TMAO levels remained unchanged after 12 months of dialysis treatment, it decreased dramatically after Rtx (p<0.001).
PMC4709190	R02002	In contrast, choline and betaine levels increased significantly after 12 months of dialysis (p<0.01 and p<0.001, respectively) and continued to rise after Rtx.
PMC4709190	R02004	Choline and betaine levels increased with dialysis and Rtx whereas TMAO levels remained unchanged during dialysis and normalized after Rtx.
PMC4709190	R02010	Abbreviations and definitions: Rtx, renal transplantation; SGA, subjective global assessment with score > 1 indicating presence of protein-energy wasting; Alb, albumin; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate assessed by cystatin C clearance.
PMC4709190	R03000	When analyzing the total CKD cohort, correlations were observed between TMAO and IL-6 (Rho = 0.42; p<0.0001) and fibrinogen (Rho = 0.43; p<0.0001).
PMC4709190	R03001	A similar trend was observed for choline and IL-6 (Rho = 0.26; p = 0.007), but not for choline and fibrinogen.
PMC4709190	R03002	Betaine levels were inversely correlated with both IL-6 (Rho = -0.21; p = 0.029) and fibrinogen (Rho -0.34; p<0.0001).
PMC4709190	R03003	A weak, but significant, correlation was observed between TMAO and hsCRP (Rho = 0.17; p = 0.022), but not for choline or betaine.
PMC4709190	R03004	Comparative analysis of inflamed (hsCRP ≥ 10 mg/L) and non-inflamed patients (hsCRP < 10 mg/L), demonstrated higher TMAO levels (p<0.002) and lower betaine levels (p = 0.031) in inflamed patients.
PMC4709190	R03005	Higher hsCRP levels associated with higher TMAO levels and decreased betaine levels.
PMC4709190	R03008	In regression analysis assessing the effect of metabolites and mGFR on degree of inflammation in the total CKD cohort, GFR was the dominant variable in the TMAO and betaine models.
PMC4709190	R03009	Only betaine and fibrinogen maintained a significant association (β = -0.153, p = 0.015, r_2 = 0.54), whereas TMAO and choline had no significant effect on the estimate for IL-6, fibrinogen or hsCRP when GFR was taken into account.
PMC4709190	R04001	Kaplan-Meier analysis of metabolites divided in tertiles revealed that levels of TMAO, but not choline or betaine, were associated with decreased survival.
PMC4709190	R04002	CKD patients with the highest TMAO levels (Combined middle; 32.2–75.2 μM/L+ high tertile; >72.2 μM/L) had a significantly lower survival compared with patients in the lowest TMAO tertile (<32.2 μM/L)
PMC4709190	R04004	In unadjusted Cox-regression analysis higher TMAO levels were associated with a 6.3-fold risk increase for all-cause mortality.
PMC4709190	R04007	CKD patients with the highest TMAO levels (Combined middle (32.2–75.2 μM/L) + high tertile (>72.2 μM/L)) had a significantly lower survival compared with patients in the lowest TMAO tertile.
PMC4716538	A02001	LASSO-LR identified three discriminatory metabolites: 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, 3-indoxylsulfate, and alanine, which produced a discriminatory model with an area under the ROC of 0.95.
PMC4716538	A05008	Previous studies show that GC cells preferentially convert glucose into lactate even in the presence of sufficient oxygen (Warburg effect) (; ; ; ).
PMC4716538	A05009	Citrate is one metabolite with connections to apoptotic pathways in GC.
PMC4716538	A05010	Certain nucleic acids are overexpressed in GC (hypoxanthine, uridine, guanosine), indicating active replication (; ; ).
PMC4716538	D00003	Five to seven percent of skeletal muscle is composed of alanine, an endogenous amino acid.
PMC4716538	D00004	During fasting, muscle protein is catabolised to release alanine for liver gluconeogenesis.
PMC4716538	D00005	Similar to previous studies (; ), alanine concentration increased from HE to GC.
PMC4716538	D00006	Elevated alanine levels in GC patients' urine compared with HE show that alanine may be a biomarker of muscle wasting but not necessarily a specific biomarker of the disease itself.
PMC4716538	D00007	In rats with chemically induced gastric lesions (ulcers, erosions), treatment with 1-methylnicotinamide inhibited gastric acid secretion and increased mucosal blood flow and healing.
PMC4716538	D00008	Diminished levels of 1-methylnicotinamide in both BN and GC groups suggest loss of this mucosal protective mechanism.
PMC4716538	D00009	Where mucosa is ulcerated or eroded, sucrose can penetrate more easily into the bloodstream and be excreted into the urine.
PMC4716538	D00010	Our study shows significant sucrose elevations in both BN and GC groups compared with HE.
PMC4716538	D00012	Creatinine, a waste product of muscle metabolism, is excreted by the kidneys.
PMC4716538	D00013	The amount of creatinine in urine is related to muscle mass.
PMC4716538	D00014	Cachectic patients have lower total body skeletal muscle mass and therefore lower levels of urinary creatinine.
PMC4716538	D00016	Citrate is an intermediate of the Kreb's cycle.
PMC4716538	D00017	An in vitro experiment showed that citrate induced apoptosis in two GC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner.
PMC4716538	D00018	In our study, citrate was downregulated in GC patients, suggesting an ability of GC to escape regular programmed cell death.
PMC4716538	R00005	Of particular interest were nine metabolites, which had high VIP scores in the GC vs HE OPLS model but low VIP scores in the BN vs HE OPLS model: sucrose, dimethylamine, 1-methylnicotinamide, 2-furoylglycine, N-acetylserotonin, trans-aconitate, alanine, formate, and serotonin.
PMC4716538	R00009	LASSO-LR produced an optimal GC vs HE model using just three metabolites: 2-hydroxyisobutyrate (2-HIB), 3-indoxylsulfate (3-IS), and alanine (A).
PMC4794249	A00001	We hypothesised that the reportedly lower aerobic performance in non-carriers compared to carriers of the ACE I-allele, i.e. ACE-DD vs. ACE-ID/ACE-II genotype, is associated with alterations in activity-induced glucose metabolism and capillarisation in exercise muscle.
PMC4794249	A01001	Respiratory exchange ratio (RER), serum glucose and lipid concentration, glycogen, and metabolite content in vastus lateralis muscle based on ultra-performance lipid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS), were assessed before and after the cycling exercise in thirty-three participants.
PMC4794249	A02000	Cycling exercise reduced muscle glycogen concentration and this tended to be affected by the ACE I-allele (p = 0.09).
PMC4794249	A02001	The ACE-DD genotype showed a lower maximal RER and a selective increase in serum glucose concentration after exercise compared to ACE-ID and ACE-II genotypes (+24% vs. +2% and –3%, respectively).
PMC4794249	A02002	Major metabolites of mitochondrial metabolism (i.e. phosphoenol pyruvate, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, L-Aspartic acid, glutathione) were selectively affected in vastus lateralis muscle by exercise in the ACE-DD genotype.
PMC4794249	A02004	Individuals with the ACE-DD genotype demonstrated an abnormal increase in serum glucose to 7.7 mM after the marathon.
PMC4794249	A03000	The observations imply a genetically modulated role for ACE in control of glucose import and oxidation in working skeletal muscle.
PMC4794249	D00004	The comparison of the response to exhaustive cycling exercise identified that ACE-DD genotypes showed compared to ACE-ID and ACE-II genotypes a pronounced perturbation in serum glucose concentration, concomitantly with a reduced RER and modified abundance of critical muscle metabolites in knee extensor muscles.
PMC4794249	D01000	Forward to testing the hypothesis on a capillary-related reduction in glucose metabolism during exercise in ACE-DD genotypes we assessed the metabolic response to a bout of one-legged cycling exercise and verified selected markers of metabolism after the exhaustive physical effort of a marathon race.
PMC4794249	D01008	The relevance and robustness of our approach is further supported by the observation that the identified genotype difference in serum alterations of glucose after one-legged exercise was confirmed after the exhaustive type of running exercise as presented by the completion of a marathon.
PMC4794249	D01009	A number of factors potentially explain the suggested difference in glucose handling between carriers and non-carriers of the ACE I-allele.
PMC4794249	D01011	The identified ACE-I/D genotype dependent metabolites 30 min post exercises were associated with the metabolism of pyruvate (PEP, NADP), glucose and amino acids (saccharopine, L-aspartic acid, methylhyppuric acid) as well as of glutathione (glutathione, 2-bromacetaldehyde; ; ).
PMC4794249	D01013	In this regard, the lowered abundance of the reduction equivalent NADP and the glycolytic intermediate PEP would be in line with a reduced glycolytic energy production; leading to an attenuated decrease in glycogen content in ACE-DD genotypes.
PMC4794249	D01014	Support for the ACE I/D polymorphism-dependent modification of glucose metabolism in working muscle was presented by a reduced RER during the exhaustive exercise in ACE-DD genotypes (Figs and ).
PMC4794249	D01015	In this regard the concomitant reduction of methylhippuric acid is of interest as this is a marker of a deregulated ß-oxidation of fatty acids.
PMC4794249	D01016	Notably, the lowered abundance of L-Aspartic acid and the concomitant increase in saccharopine (a degradation product of lysine) are suggestive for an elevation of amino-acid degradation in the exercised muscle of ACE-DD genotypes after the exhaustive one-legged exercise.
PMC4794249	D01017	In our experiments we identified that negative linear relationships existed for three metabolism-related parameters and the time to complete the marathon race, i.e. glucose concentration prior to the race, capillary density and V˙O2max.
PMC4794249	D01019	We interpret this observation as to reflect the role of the aerobic oxidation of glucose for performance in the exhaustive type of exercise.
PMC4794249	D01022	Overall the results from the snapshot of metabolism post-exercise emphasize that compounds of anaplerotic reactions that replenish TCA cycle intermediates (i.e. aspartate and PEP), were selectively reduced in ACE-DD genotypes after exercise.
PMC4794249	D01023	Concomitantly, compounds related to the removal of metabolic intermediates from the TCA cycle (cataplerosis) were less increased during recovery from exercise in ACE-DD genotypes (i.e. saccharopine, glutathione and PEP, ).
PMC4794249	D01029	The identified differences in serum glucose concentration between ACE genotypes after the lab test were remarkably well confirmed by the pronounced rise in serum glucose after the field test.
PMC4794249	D01030	Conversely exercise-induced changes in serum levels of triglyceride were not affected by the ACE-I/D polymorphism (i.e. ).
PMC4794249	D01032	Higher RER values are indicative of an increased glucose oxidation.
PMC4794249	D01033	Thus, our findings are indicative of a reduction in glucose oxidation in non-carriers of the ACE I-allele with one-legged exercise.
PMC4794249	D01034	Because skeletal muscle is a main contributor to energy utilisation with exercise, our finding suggests that the elevated serum concentration of glucose in non-carriers of the ACE I-allele reflects a relatively reduced oxidation of glucose in contracting muscle.
PMC4794249	D01035	This is supported by a correlation between the changes in serum glucose and the average RER during the one-legged exercise.
PMC4794249	D01036	To our understanding, the connected changes identified here are the first to indicate that a modified muscle metabolism and glucose handling underlies the effect of the ACE-I/D polymorphism on the activity-induced metabolic phenotype in men [,].
PMC4794249	D01037	Overall the present novel findings lead us to the interpretation that the lack of an ACE I-allele, in the studied subjects, is a disadvantageous condition for aerobic energy metabolism during and after endurance work which is compensated by a shift in energy production to metabolic alternatives of glucose oxidation.
PMC4794249	D01038	Intriguingly, serum values of glucose in ACE-DD genotypes were high enough (mean of 7.9 mM) to technically meet the criteria of hyperglycaemia.
PMC4794249	D01039	Serum glucose levels are tightly regulated in an interval between 4 and 7 mM through the regulation of the rate of glucose appearance and the rate of glucose disappearance.
PMC4794249	D01040	Elevations in serum glucose occur with the increase in hepatic glucose output such as after a meal.
PMC4794249	D01041	This can be excluded as explanation for our observation since subjects were fasted and angiotensin 2 does not regulate hepatic glucose.
PMC4794249	D01042	By contrast the rate of glucose disappearance is affected by angiotensin 2/ACE through effects on insulin [,].
PMC4794249	D01043	Given that hepatic glucose output is also increased with exercise our findings of an ACE-I/D modulated response of pathways related to glucose handling with exercise suggest a deficiency in the rate of glucose uptake in the largest organ of insulin action, skeletal muscle, which contributes up to 80% to whole body glucose disposal.
PMC4794249	D01044	It has been pointed out before that the uptake of liver-derived glucose in contracting muscle is importantly increased within minutes after the onset of exercise and depends on enhanced perfusion of contracting skeletal muscle [,].
PMC4794249	D01045	Capillaries are a main effector for the vasodilatative action of insulin and the degree of glucose tolerance is positively correlated with capillary density in skeletal muscle.
PMC4794249	D01046	Therefore the rise in serum glucose with insulin resistance with type 2 diabetes appears to be mainly due to an incapacity for glucose uptake through the capillary endothelium.
PMC4794249	D01048	vastus lateralis of ACE-DD genotypes; indicates that capillarisation is a possible limiting factor for glucose supply during endurance exercise in this genotype.
PMC4794249	D01050	The investigation highlights that the suggested deficit in glucose metabolism with exhaustive exercise in the studied ACE-DD genotypes, as reflected by the accumulation of blood glucose, is related to a reduced capillarisation in the largest organ system of insulin action, skeletal muscle.
PMC4794249	D01052	Our findings indicate that this risk can be exposed in otherwise healthy subjects by assessing markers of glucose metabolism after an exhaustive test of exercise (especially the out-of norm elevation of glucose levels after exhaustive exercise).
PMC4794249	D01053	Our findings also build a connection between glucose handling and serum angiotensin 2 levels.
PMC4794249	D01054	For instance we identified a correlation between the fold changes in angiotensin 2 and muscle capillary density (r = 0. 65) and changes in glucose (r = –0.846; p = 0.008) after one-legged exercise.
PMC4794249	D01055	These latter observations are of interest given that the enzyme activity of ACE is regulated by shear stress acting on the endothelial lumen such a during exercise induced hyperemia and because angiotensin 2 which increases in function of exercise intensity affects arterio-venous glucose extraction and glucose utilisation in contracting muscle [,].
PMC4794249	D01056	In our study serum angiotensin 2 concentrations were higher in ACE-DD genotypes at rest as predicted based on the effect of the presence of the ACE I-allele on the expression of ACE and the downstream processing of angiotensin 2.
PMC4794249	D01057	However, serum angiotensin 2 concentrations were not increased in ACE-DD genotypes after endurance exercise.
PMC4794249	D01058	We have recently identified that variability in the rise in serum angiotensin 2 after intense exercise and capillary perfusion is related to the ACE I/D polymorphism.
PMC4794249	D01059	In this regard the overshoot of serum glucose post exercise in ACE-DD genotypes is of interest as these subjects may miss a vasodilatatory response post-exercise.
PMC4794249	D01060	Together, these relationships suggest that variability in serum glucose concentration with exhaustive muscle work is related to the capillary lumen that is serving the contracting musculature.
PMC4794249	D01061	Our findings imply that genetic effects of the ACE I-allele on serum angiotensin 2 levels modulate the former association.
PMC4794249	M04002	A 5-ml blood sample was drawn from the Cephalic vein into a tube sprayed with dry EDTA (K2E BD Vacutainer_® , Belliver Industrial Estate, Phymouth, UK) and placed on ice.

PMC4845212	D00008	Although the TMAO level has been suggested to be involved in atherosclerosis,4, 5 and many cohort studies have suggested that an increased number of adverse outcomes are associated with high TMAO levels,4, 5, 6, 7 no reports have examined the increase in TMAO levels in asymptomatic atherosclerosis patients.
PMC4845212	D00009	Our present results did not find an increase in the TMAO levels of asymptomatic atherosclerosis patients, which indicated that more research is needed to evaluate the fasting blood TMAO level in relation to the risk assessment of atherosclerosis; however, our study found that the blood TMAO level is lower in stroke and TIA patients.
PMC4845212	D00010	We postulate that either the stroke event or the treatment may reduce TMAO, and that may be clarified with further animal studies.
PMC4845212	M04001	The TMAO levels in plasma were determined using stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (6460 Series Triple Quadrupole LC/MS; Agilent), as described previously.19 Plasma (50 μL) was aliquoted to a 1.5‐mL tube and mixed with 200 μL of a 10 μmol/L internal standard composed of d9‐TMAO in methanol.

PMC4868723	D00032	Recently, Wei and colleagues have examined the anti-tumor activity of oleanolic acid on pancreatic cancer cells.
PMC4868723	D00033	The results of these studies provide evidence that it is able to arrest the cell cycle and induce apoptosis, possibly via ROS-mediated mitochondrial, and lysosomal pathway in Panc-28 cells, which resulted reversible by using the ROS scavenger vitamin C. The expression of apoptosis-correlated proteins was also affected in cells exposed tooleanolic acid, including activation of caspases-3/9 and cleavage of PARP.
PMC4868723	D00034	Further study revealed others mechanism of action of oleanolic acid, such as mitochondrial depolarization, release of cytochrome C, lysosomal membrane permeabilization and leakage of cathepinB. MS-based lipidomic analysis of sphingolipids from metastatic pancreatic tissues revealed discrete and significant changes in specific ceramide molecule as compared to either pancreatic cancers without metastases or non-cancerous pancreatitis specimens.
PMC4868723	D00035	Sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) manifest diverse biological, biochemical and biophysical functions that mediate, in part, cellular proliferation, migration, tumorigenesis, apoptosis and inflammation [, ] and are implicated in tumor growth of pancreatic stellate cells.
PMC4868723	D00036	Mechanistically, sphingosine and S1P are typically considered pro-inflammatory, pro-mitogenic, and/or chemotaxic lipids that may facilitate the progression of pancreatic cancer, and it has been recognized and accepted by most researchers that sphingosine kinase acts like an oncogene and is upregulated in many human cancers.
PMC4868723	D00037	Out of three sphingolipids included in our study one was sphingosine which resulted significantly higher (0.24±0.04 μM, mean±SD) in PC patients than normal controls (0.09±0.08 μM, mean±SD).
PMC4868723	D00038	Our data were keeping with a previous study performed by Jiang et al., who reported elevated levels in plasma of PC subjects of ceramide metabolites, including phosphorylated (sphingosine- and sphinganine-1-phosphate) and glycosylated (cerebroside) species.
PMC4868723	D00039	The deregulation of sphingolipid metabolism was associated with more advanced and aggressive behavior of the cancer.
PMC4868723	D00040	The estimation of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for sphingosine was 0.942 (0.877-1.000)
PMC4868723	D00043	A high-fat and low-carbohydrate diet that elevates circulating levels of ketone bodies (i.e., acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone) diminish the overall energetic health of pancreatic cancer cells by reducing glucose uptake, lactate release, glutamine uptake, cellular ATP content, and ROS levels.
PMC4868723	D00045	Diets with a high fat content stimulate bile secretion, which increases the availability of cholesterol, bile acids and their metabolites.
PMC4868723	D00047	Bile acids are steroid metabolites of cholesterol functioning as trophic factors for gut epithelium and as detergents for absorption of cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins.
PMC4868723	D00050	It has also been demonstrated that chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) administration in rat colon could enhance cell membrane phospholipid turnover, showing a significant increase of glycine and taurine conjugates species in patients with extrahepatic cholestasis.
PMC4868723	D00053	Instead, the concentrations of conjugated (glycine and taurine) cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids were significantly higher in PC group than controls, resembling the elevation of some bile acids in jaundiced serum of PC subjects that seems to inhibit pancreatic cell growth and proliferation.
PMC4868723	D00054	In summary our mass spectrometry-based metabolomic profiling of pancreatic cancer patients and normal subjects allowed us to identify four metabolites (oleanoic acid, palmitic acid, taurochenodeoxycholate and d-sphingosine) with highly discriminative potential.
PMC4868723	D00055	Palmitic acid has a better discriminating ability in comparison to the pretherapeutic tumor marker CA 19-9 suggesting that, the joint evaluation of both pretherapeutic tumor markers CA19-9 and palmitic acid levels should be recommended in order to significantly reduce the probability to detect false positives and it could be used to improve the prognostic prediction in patients with pancreatic cancer.
PMC4868723	M00005	The first one was a combination of direct injection and LC-MS/MS assay (Absolute IDQ p180 kit, Biocrates Life Sciences AG, Innsbruck, Austria) for the analysis of amino acids and biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids and hexoses.
PMC4868723	M00006	The second one was a “custom made” LC-MS/MS assay for the analysis of bile acids, fatty acids, sterols, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids.
PMC4868723	M01003	Labeled internal standards: D3-octanoyl L-carnitineHCl, D3-hexadecanoyl L-carnitineHCl, D3-acetyl L-carnitineHCl, D3-L-carnitine HCl, D3-eicosanoic acid, D3-octadecanoic acid (D3-stearic acid) and D3-tetradecanoic acid (D3-myristic acid) were from CDN Isotope (Quebec, Canada); D7-cholesterol, D4-cholic acid, D4-chenodeoxycholic acid, D4-glycoursodeoxycholic acid, D4-glycocholic acid, D5-taurocholic acid, D5-taurodeoxycholic acid, D4-lithocholic acid were from Sigma–Aldrich (Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy).
PMC4868723	M01005	Acetonitrile (ACN), 2-propanol (IPA), methanol (CH3OH), chloroform (CHCl3) and triethylamine (TEA) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy).
PMC4868723	M01008	Formic acid (HCOOH) and ammonium formate (NH4COOH) additive for LC–MS were from FLUKA (Sigma–Aldrich, Milan, Italy).
PMC4868723	M02005	Concentrations of all analysed metabolites were reported in μM. The metabolomics dataset contains 40 acylcarnitines
PMC4868723	M02006	(Cx:y), hydroxylacylcarnitines(C(OH)x:y) and dicarboxylacylcarnitines (Cx:y-DC); 40 amino acids and biogenic amines; one sugar; 10 sphingomyelins (SMx:y) and sphingomyelin-derivatives (SM(OH)x:y); and 90 glycerophospholipids (PC).
PMC4868723	M02007	Glycerophospholipids are differentiated with respect to the presence of ester (a) and ether (e) bonds in the glycerol moiety, where two letters (aa = diacyl, ae = acyl-alkyl) denote that two glycerol positions are bound to a fatty acid residue, while a single letter (a = acyl) indicates the presence of a single fatty acid residue.
PMC4868723	M03000	An Ostro™ 96-well plate (Waters, Milford, MA, U.S.A.) was used to extract from human sera of a series of metabolites belonging to different classes of lipids: bile acids, fatty acids, sterols, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids.
PMC4868723	M03001	The sera samples (50 μL) were loaded into the well plate and spiked with two internal standard solutions (50 μL of 50 μM of labeled bile acids and 10 μL of 500 μM of labeled lipids), mixed with 500 μL of acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (v/v) and transferred to a 96-well vacuum manifold where vacuum suction was applied for extraction.
PMC4868723	M03004	The resulting eluent was collected in a 96-well collection plate and dried using N2 gas at 40°C, and finally reconstituted in 50 μL of MeOH:H2O 50:50 (v/v).
PMC4868723	M03005	The precipitated material into the well plate was washed twice with 800μL of a solution of MeOH:
PMC4868723	M03006	CHCl_3 :TEA (45:45:10, v/v/v) and transferred to a 96-well vacuum manifold where vacuum suction was applied for the elution of the phospholipids retained in the first step.
PMC4868723	M03007	The resulting eluent was collected in a 96-well collection plate and was dried using N2 gas at 40°C, and then reconstituted in 50 μL of IPA:ACN:H2O (65:30:5, v/v/v).
PMC4868723	R01001	Four of these metabolites showed the highest cooperative discriminant potential, even though at a different extent: palmitic acid and oleanolic acid were the most perturbed metabolites.
PMC4868723	R01002	D-sphingosine and T-CDCA (taurochenodeoxycholate) were mildly discriminating factors.
PMC4868723	R01006	As shown in Figure , palmitic acid and D-sphingosine modulate cell viability, apoptosis, cell cycle, migration and invasion in the frame of pancreatic cancer.
PMC4868723	R02006	We found that palmitic acid, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-glycerol, lanosterol, lignoceric acid, monooleoyl-rac-glycerol, cholesterol 5α,6α epoxide, erucic acid, T-LCA, oleoyl-L-carnitine, oleanolic acid clearly achieved the highest importance values than all other metabolites.
PMC4868723	R03002	As shown, all metabolites previously found at the RF analysis (i.e., palmitic acid, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-rac-glycerolcholesterol 5α,6α epoxidelanosterol, lignoceric acid, 1oleoyl_rac_GL, cholesterol_epoxide, erucic acid, T-LCA, oleoyl-L-carnitine, oleanolic acid) achieved the highest discriminatory power (AUC=1.00, 95%CI: 1.00-1.00), suggesting that all the estimated cut-offs points perfectly discriminate patients form healthy controls.
PMC4868723	R04003	Among all screened metabolites, we found that palmitic acid achieved the highest discriminatory power to distinguish PC patients from healthy controls.
PMC4868723	R04005	Plots of the ROC curves and the boxplots of metabolite levels were reported in Figure for palmitic acid (upper left and upper right) and for CA 19-9 (bottom left and bottom right), separately.
PMC4868723	R04008	Similarly, the AUC for palmitic acid was 1.000, along with a 95%CI of 1.000-1.000.
PMC4868723	R04009	The best cut-off was found at the value of 134.38 μM, where palmitic acid achieved a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100%.
PMC4932762	A00000	Individual patients show a large variability in albuminuria response to angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB).
PMC4932762	A01001	Data from patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria (n = 49) treated with irbesartan 300 mg/day were used for discovery.
PMC4932762	A01004	The classifier was externally validated in patients with type 1 diabetes and macroalbuminuria (n = 50) treated with losartan 100 mg/day.
PMC4932762	A02001	The classifier, consisting of 21 metabolites, was significantly associated with UAE response to irbesartan (p < 0.001) and improved prediction of UAE response on top of the clinical reference model (R_2 increase from 0.10 to 0.70;
PMC4932762	A02004	The classifier improved prediction of UAE response to losartan (R_2 increase from 0.20 to 0.59; p < 0.001).
PMC4932762	A02005	Specifically ADMA impacting eNOS activity appears to be a relevant factor in ARB response.
PMC4932762	D00008	Pharmacological blockade of angiotensin II activity by ARBs is currently the most widely used therapeutic option, next to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), for treatment of hypertension and albuminuria in diabetes mellitus.
PMC4932762	D00024	The combined losartan/irbesartan mechanism of action molecular model included a total of 48 protein coding genes retrieved from literature mining.
PMC4932762	D00026	While losartan and irbesartan are different molecules, we speculated that this would not affect the predictive ability of the serum metabolite classifier.
PMC4932762	D00027	Indeed, this appears to be the case as the classifier was able to predict albuminuria response in both losartan and irbesartan.
PMC4932762	D00028	A key finding from the molecular process analysis is the relevance of nitric oxide (NO) in ARB response, as illustrated by the direct interference of ARB molecular mechanism of action and DKD molecular model by the enzyme NOS3, and further reflected by the inclusion of ADMA and citrulline in the serum metabolite classifier.
PMC4932762	D00029	ADMA, an endogeneous NO synthase inhibitor, is considered relevant in endothelial dysfunction contributing to extracellular matrix remodeling and being involved in inflammation.
PMC4932762	D00030	Increased ADMA levels have been shown to contribute to increased risk of progressive DKD and predict fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events in patients with type 1 diabetic nephropathy.
PMC4932762	D00031	The positive beta values for ADMA in the regression models suggest that higher concentrations of the metabolite are associated with less albuminuria reduction.
PMC4932762	D00032	We therefore speculate that higher concentrations of ADMA lead to increased blockade of NOS3, resulting in a decrease in NO availability and diminished albuminuria response.
PMC4932762	D00033	Furthermore, citrulline, catalyzed by NOS3, has been shown to be inversely correlated to inflammatory parameters such as C-reactive protein.
PMC4932762	D00034	Supplementation with citrulline has been shown to increase arginine/ADMA ratio, in turn decreasing blood pressure and improving vascular function.
PMC4932762	D00035	Our study points to higher concentrations of citrulline associated with greater reductions in albuminuria.
PMC4932762	D00036	ADMA and citrulline assignments in the drug molecular model and DKD molecular model further suggest that albuminuria response to ARBs is reflected on the background of progressive disease as well as influenced by eNOS activity.
PMC4932762	D00041	Furthermore, interferences at the process units at the direct drug target together with the bradykinin system and on NFκB/PPARγ indicate involvement of inflammatory processes and lipid metabolism contributing to ARB response.
PMC4932762	D00049	Limitations of this study include lack of comprehensiveness of drug mechanism of action characterization as the combined losartan/irbesartan mechanism of action molecular model was developed only from published literature.
PMC4932762	M00003	For the discovery cohort, we used data from a crossover clinical study in type 2 diabetes assessing the effect of the ARB irbesartan.
PMC4932762	M00006	At inclusion, previous antihypertensive treatment was discontinued and replaced with bendroflumethiazide, 5 mg once daily, for the entire study.
PMC4932762	M00007	Following 2 months wash-out (baseline), patients were treated randomly with irbesartan 300, 600, and 900 mg once daily.
PMC4932762	M00008	All treatment periods were of 10 weeks’ duration and consisted of an initial two-week dose titration period with irbesartan 300 mg once daily followed by 8 weeks treatment with irbesartan 300, 600, and 900 mg once daily in random order.
PMC4932762	M00011	For the external validation cohort, we used data from a clinical study in type 1 diabetes assessing the effect of the ARB losartan.
PMC4932762	M00013	After a four-week washout, the patients received 100 mg losartan once daily and were followed prospectively with a mean follow-up period of 36 months.
PMC4932762	M00015	For the validation cohort, we defined the outcome of interest as percent change in UAE from baseline to UAE after 16 weeks of treatment of losartan 100 mg/day.
PMC4932762	M00017	We expected the treatment effect of irbesartan and losartan on albuminuria to be fully present after 12 or 16 weeks of treatment, respectively.
PMC4932762	M01003	The full set of 185 metabolites from the following chemical classes were quantified: acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, energy/sugar metabolism (Hexoses), lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelins.
PMC4932762	M01004	The quantification of amino acids, acylcarnitines, sphingomyelins, phosphatidylcholines, hexose (glucose), and biogenic amines was performed using a AbsoluteIDQ™ p180 kit .

PMC4932762	R00007	Median change in UAE was −43 % [Q1–Q3: −23 to −62] over 16 weeks of treatment with losartan 100 mg/day (Table ).

PMC4951105	A00001	Fragments of the tumor, acquired by biopsy or surgical resection, may be acid-extracted and _13 C NMR spectroscopy of metabolites such as glutamate, glutamine, 2-hydroxyglutarate, lactate and others provide a rich source of information about tumor metabolism in situ .
PMC4951105	A00002	Recently we observed _13 C-_13 C spin-spin coupling in _13 C NMR spectra of lactate in brain tumors removed from patients who were infused with [1,2-_13 C]acetate prior to the surgery.
PMC4951105	A00003	We found, in four patients, that infusion of _13 C-enriched acetate was associated with synthesis of _13 C-enriched glucose, detectable in plasma.
PMC4951105	A00004	_13 C labeled glucose derived from [1,2-_13 C]acetate metabolism in the liver and the brain pyruvate recycling in the tumor together lead to the production of the _13 C labeled lactate pool in the brain tumor.
PMC4951105	A00005	Their combined contribution to acetate metabolism in the brain tumors was less than 4.0%, significantly lower than the direct oxidation of acetate in the citric acid cycle in tumors.

PMC4951105	R00000	The simple metabolic pathway for metabolism of [1,2-_13 C]acetate in a brain tumor is its conversion to acetyl-CoA and oxidation to CO_2 in the citric acid cycle, and thus providing no direct mechanism for _13 C entry into the lactate pool of the tumor.
PMC4951105	R00004	[1,2-_13 C] and [2,3-_13 C] isotopomers of glucose in the plasma would generate [2,3-_13 C]pyruvate and [1,2-_13 C]pyruvate, respectively, in the tumor which would yield the same _13 C labeled isotopomers of lactate.
PMC4951105	R00005	Amounts of [1,2-_13 C] (C2D12), [2,3-_13 C] (C3D23) isotopomers of lactate in the tumor (n=4) are 0.30±0.07, 0.17±0.02 respectively and [2,3-_13 C] (C2D23),
PMC4951105	R00006	[1,2-_13 C] (C1D12) in plasma glucose are 0.23±0.05, 0.17±0.04 respectively.
PMC4951105	R00007	Similar values of C3D23, C2D12 of tumor lactate and C1D12, C2D23 plasma glucose suggest that [1,2-_13 C]acetate leads to the production of _13 C enriched glucose generated in the liver through gluconeogenesis, which then enters the brain to generate corresponding _13 C enriched lactate isotopomers through glycolysis.
PMC4951105	R00008	C3D23 tumor lactate value (0.17±0.02) is same to the value of C1D12 of plasma glucose (0.17±0.04), which suggests that _13 C labeled glucose from [1,2-_13 C]acetate metabolism in the liver is the main source of [2,3-_13 C]lactate in the brain tumor.
PMC4951105	R00009	However, C1D12 tumor lactate value (0.30±0.07) is slightly higher than C2D23 of plasma glucose value of (0.23±0.05).
PMC4951105	R00010	This small difference in the [1,2-_13 C] isotopomer in the tumor lactate pool could be due to the effect of other metabolic pathways within the tumor.
PMC4951105	R00012	As shown in , pyruvate recycling produces equimolar mixture of [1,2-_13 C] and [3-_13 C] pyruvate isotopomers from [1,2-_13 C] and [3,4-_13 C] OAA isotopomers through the activity of either malic enzyme or combined activity of the enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and pyruvate kinase (PK).
PMC4951105	R00013	[1,2-_13 C]pyruvate isotopomer produced from the pyruvate recycling pathway could also contribute to the production of [1,2-_13 C]lactate in the brain tumor lactate pool.
PMC4951105	R00014	Also, [1,2-_13 C] pyruvate isotopomers could produce mono-labeled [1-_13 C]acetyl-CoA (Fc1; fraction of acetyl-CoA _13 C enriched only in its carbonyl carbon, C1) through the enzymatic action of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), which was determined from C5 glutamate _13 C resonance signal through the ratio between C5 glutamate singlet and doublet C5D multiplied by the total [1,2-_13 C]acetyl-CoA, which in this case was 3.1%±0.9%.
PMC4951105	R00015	Without the contribution from pyruvate recycling and the hepatic gluconeogenesis contributions, Fc1 should be at the _13 C isotope natural abundance value of 1.1%. _13 C fractional enrichment of plasma glucose is 4.0%±1.0% (from _1 H NMR spectra of plasma glucose, data not shown) and its contribution to the total Fc1 cannot exceed more than 0.8%.
PMC4951105	R00016	Therefore, the rest of the Fc1 contributions (~2%) are likely due to the activity of pyruvate recycling in the brain tumor.
PMC4951105	R00017	Based on the C1D12 value of plasma glucose of 0.17±0.04, its contribution to the [1,2-_13 C]acetyl-CoA pool in the brain tumor from peripheral metabolism of acetate cannot be more than 0.7%, which further confirms our earlier report of [1,2-_13 C]acetate being directly oxidized in human GBM and brain metastasis, contributing up to 48%±4% of [1,2-_13 C]acetyl-CoA production in the tumor.
PMC4951105	R00018	Additionally, _13 C-labeled lactate isotopomers (C2D12 and C3D23) were also detected in plasma, which could be a source of the _13 C-labeling observed in the lactate pool in the tumor.
PMC4951105	R00019	Similar values of _13 C fractional enrichments of plasma glucose (C1 carbon) and C3 lactate in the tumor observed from _1 H NMR spectroscopy may suggest that _13 C labeled plasma glucose will be one of the main source for the lactate _13 C labeling detected in the tumors reported in this study.

PMC4960975	D00017	We summarized the alterations in three critical pathways: (1) fatty acid metabolism (β-oxidation), (2) glycolysis/TCA cycle, and (3) the homocysteine/methylamine pathways in sarcoidosis patients.
PMC4960975	D00018	Furthermore, both MetaboAnalyst 3.0 and the KEGG data base analyses of our data pointed towards aberrant microbiota and colon microbiome, identifying abnormalities in butanoate metabolism and methylamine (TMAO).
PMC4960975	D00019	Gut microbiota, especially anaerobic bacteria are the major producer of butyrate.
PMC4960975	D00020	Interestingly, butyrate has been shown to be important in the modulation of T cell immunity and it affects histone acetylation (, ).
PMC4960975	D00021	In addition, metabolism of l-carnitine by intestinal microbiota has been recently linked to increased levels of inflammation and cardiovascular risk.
PMC4960975	D00022	Wang et al. have shown that metabolism of choline and phosphatidylcholine, as well as dietary l-carnitine (abundant in red meat) by gut microbiota leads to production of the hepatic metabolite trimethylamine (TMA), which is further oxidized to trimethylamine
PMC4960975	D00024	That study showed that generation of TMAO from dietary TMA is dependent on the composition of intestinal microbiota, as suppression of gut microbiota with oral broad-spectrum antibiotics led to a decrease in plasma TMAO (19).
PMC4960975	D00025	Both TMA and TMAO are found to be directly linked to the composition of the intestinal microbiota and are considered biomarkers for inflammation and atherosclerosis (, ).
PMC4960975	D00026	Taken together, our untargeted metabolomic analysis revealed elevated TMAO levels and abnormalities in butanoate metabolism in patients with sarcoidosis raising concern for an association of abnormal gut microflora and chronic inflammation in these patients.
PMC4960975	D00027	l l Several metabolites associated with the fatty acid β–oxidation pathway were increased in patients with sarcoidosis, including 3-HB, acetoacetate, and carnitine.
PMC4960975	D00028	Initial steps of β–oxidation occur in the cytoplasm, where fatty acid oxidation is catalyzed through acyl CoA ligase, and then transported into the mitochondria via an acyl-carnitine intermediate.
PMC4960975	D00029	In the mitochondria, saturated acyl-CoA is degraded by oxidation at the β-carbon.
PMC4960975	D00030	An increase in ketone bodies (3-HB, acetoacetate) suggests activation of mitochondrial β-oxidation as a marker for lipolysis in sarcoidosis.
PMC4960975	D00031	Further, it is known that acylcarnitines originate as intermediates during transport of substrates across mitochondrial membranes and increased concentrations could indicate an increased flux into the β-oxidation pathway.
PMC4960975	D00032	Additionally, there is a possibility that the butanoate pathway through aberrant gut microbiota contributes to increased ketone body production, as it has been shown that acetate is normally regarded as an end product of anaerobic fermentation and is an integral part of the butyrate pathway.
PMC4960975	D00033	In addition, the level of carnitine was significantly increased (p < 0.05) in sarcoidosis patients, indicating that its higher concentration is not the limiting factor of transfer of acetyl-CoA or its analogs into the mitochondria for further utilization via the TCA cycle or β-oxidation.
PMC4960975	D00034	Recently O’Sullivan et al., using an isolated murine T cell system, have shown that differentiation of memory T cells requires fatty acid oxidation to generate ATP for development and survival (; ).
PMC4960975	D00039	Likewise, choline and its metabolite, betaine, are methyl donors, and are metabolically linked to transmethylation pathways, including synthesis of the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor homocysteine.
PMC4960975	D00040	Our results did not show a significant difference in choline and betaine concentrations, but homocysteine and cystine were significantly increased in sarcoidosis patients, indicating an alteration in the transmethylation pathway.
PMC4960975	D00041	High levels of homocysteine were also previously associated with alteration in immune cell function, perhaps inducing T cell and monocyte activation, resulting in T cell differentiation into a Th1 phenotype.
PMC4960975	D00042	Our metabolomic analysis revealed a significant increase in the level of pyruvate suggesting activation of the glycolytic pathway.
PMC4960975	D00043	Because it is known that macro-phage activation leads to glycolysis and enhanced anaerobic metabolism, we expected to have increased levels of lactate in our patients.
PMC4960975	D00044	Although, the lactate levels were increased in our patients, they did not reach statistical significance (p > 0.05).
PMC4960975	D00045	Surprisingly, we found significantly decreased levels of succinate in sarcoidosis patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.003).
PMC4960975	D00047	Pyruvate plays a central role in human metabolism.
PMC4960975	D00048	Two key enzymes regulate pyruvate metabolism (1) pyruvate dehydrogenase and (2) pyruvate car-boxylase, by which pyruvate is transformed to acetyl-CoA or through carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate.
PMC4960975	D00050	It was reported that during hypoxia or inflammation, citrate plays an important feature of the metabolic switch regulating mitochondrial dysfunction.
PMC4960975	D00051	Citrate can be converted into cytosolic acetyl-CoA without passing through the conventional clockwise steps of the TCA cycle.
PMC4960975	D00052	Acetyl-CoA generated by this pathway can function as a precursor for fatty acid synthesis (; ).
PMC4960975	D00053	These alternative pathways may contribute to restoration of other TCA intermediates (malate, oxaloacetate and citrate) and could explain their normal levels compared to succinate.
PMC4960975	D00054	Additionally, isoleucine and glutamine which feed into TCA cycle to generate succinate were similarly decreased.
PMC4960975	D00055	It has been shown that macrophages in response to Tolllike receptor 4 (TLR4) activation switch their metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis, leading to rapid accumulation of succinate.
PMC4960975	D00056	The same study showed that such increased succinate is dependent on glutamine.
PMC4960975	D00057	We found increased glycolysis as indicated by increased pyruvate levels, but this was not associated with an increase in succinate.
PMC4960975	D00058	In contrast, succinate and important branched amino acids such as isoleucine and glutamine were decreased.
PMC4960975	D00060	Glutamine is an abundant free amino acid in the circulation and in the intracellular amino acid pool of most tissues.
PMC4960975	D00061	Previously, it has been shown that glutamine is beneficial in severe metabolic stress, by decreasing inflammation and improving the gut barrier function (; ; ).
PMC4960975	D00062	It has been proposed that the anti-inflammatory effects of glutamine are due to a decrease in cytokine release and nuclear factor-kB activation.
PMC4960975	D00063	In addition, glutamine is an important amino acid that is known to be a key nutrient for T lymphocytes.
PMC4960975	D00064	Recently, it has been reported that the ASC amino acid transporter 2 (ASCT2) is a key regulator of glutamine uptake in CD4_+
PMC4960975	D00066	The cell-mediated immune-response depends on the availability of glutamine, which can directly impact several metabolic programs required for T cell proliferation and function.
PMC4960975	D00067	Interestingly, one previous study showed increased glutamine levels in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in contrast patients with sarcoidosis exhibited low levels of glutamine, in addition to increased TMAO levels possibly due to altered intestinal microbiota, we speculate that these metabolites may contribute to the high inflammatory state and disturbed energy metabolism found in these patients.
PMC4960975	D00068	These data augment our findings that sarcoidosis patients exhibit an increase in β-oxidation pathway along with decreased intermediates of the TCA cycle, such as succinate.
PMC4960975	M01003	A reference buffer solution containing 5 mmol/L disodium-2,2-dimethyl 2-silapentane-5-sulphonate (DSS) and 10 mmol/
PMC4960975	M01004	L imidazole in D_2 O was added to the samples in a 1:9 ratio.
PMC4960975	M01005	The D_2 O provided a field-frequency lock, whereas DSS was used as the chemical shift reference and imidazole as pH indicator for the NMR spectra.
PMC4960975	M01011	The peak ppm values were calibrated with reference to the DSS signal at 0 ppm.
PMC4960975	R01001	_1 H NMR spectra of sera provided well resolved peaks, allowing us to detect over 50 metabolites, including amino acids, intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), organic acids, and phospholipid-associated molecules.
PMC4960975	R01006	Metabolites that showed a higher concentration included 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-HB, p = 0.002), acetoacetate (p = 0.015), carnitine (p = 0.019), cystine (p = 0.000), homocysteine (p = 0.023), pyruvate (p = 0.029), and trimethylamine N -oxide (TMAO, p = 0.003).
PMC4960975	R01007	In contrast, a number of metabolites showed decreased concentrations in serum of sarcoidosis patients, such as glutamine (p = 0.013), isoleucine (p = 0.019), and succinate (p = 0.003).
PMC4960975	R01008	Although, succinate and pyruvate appeared in close proximity in the NMR spectrum (around 2.4 ppm), they were easy to distinguish owing to their characteristic peaks.
PMC4960975	R01013	Major metabolites recognized include 1 Valine; 2 3-Hydroxybutyrate; 3 Lactate; 4 Alanine; 5 Homocysteine; 6 Acetoacetate; 7 Pyruvate; 8 Citrate; 9 Choline; 10 Carnitine; 11 Trimethylamine-N -oxide; 12 Cystine; 13 Glucose Relative levels of metabolites found to be altered in sarcoidosis patients as compared with healthy controls, represented by box plots.

PMC4960975	R01015	f Pyruvate; g Trimethylamine N -oxide; h Glutamine; i Isoleucine; j Succinate.
PMC4960975	R02004	We identified a positive correlation between 3-HB and acetoacetate (R = 0.6), these metabolites being important in the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway.
PMC4960975	R02005	Homocysteine strongly correlated with cystine (R = 0.7) and carnitine (R = 0.6), indicating a connection between the homocysteine pathway, and carnitine production.
PMC4960975	R02006	Similarly, pyruvate positively correlated with carnitine (R = 0.4), TMAO (R = 0.4), and homocysteine
PMC4960975	R02008	The highest positive correlation was found between TMAO and carnitine (R = 0.8) and TMAO and homocysteine (R = 0.8).
PMC4960975	R02009	It has been shown that certain gut microbiota metabolize l-carnitine into trimethylamine (TMA), which can be further oxidized to TMAO, a highly atherogenic metabolite.
PMC4960975	R02010	In addition, even though taurine was not significantly different between the two groups, it positively correlated with carnitine (R = 0.5) and TMAO (R = 0.5).
PMC4960975	R02011	It is important to note that taurine is an intermediate in the methylamine/homocysteine pathway.
PMC4960975	R02019	SPSS software 3-HB 3-Hydroxybutyrate, TMAO trimethylamine
PMC4960975	R02020	N -oxide Isoleucine was negatively correlated with carnitine (R = −0.4), homocysteine (R = −0.4), and TMAO (R = −0.4).
PMC4960975	R02021	Similarly, succinate was negatively correlated with 3-HB (R = −0.5) and pyruvate (R = −0.5), indicating an alteration in energy production and the TCA cycle in sarcoidosis.
PMC4960975	R02022	Moreover, succinate was positively correlated with decreased levels of isoleucine (R = 0.4), an amino acid that after deamination and decarboxylation yields succinyl-CoA to feed into the TCA cycle.
PMC4960975	R02025	The significant pathways identified by MetaboAnalyst 3.0 include butanoate metabolism, alanine, aspartame and glutamate metabolism, and the synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies.
PMC4960975	R02026	In addition, the TCA cycle, tyrosine, propanoate, and phenylalanine metabolism, cysteine and methionine metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism are involved (; ).
PMC4960975	R02028	Similar, using KEGG database, we identified three major pathways altered in this disease: (1) fatty acid β-oxidation, (2) glycolysis/TCA cycle, and (3) homocysteine/methylamine.
PMC4960975	R02032	b The three major pathways include fatty acid metabolism, glycolysis/TCA cycle, and homocysteine/methylamine pathway.
PMC4965763	A00004	About 11 and 12 representative metabolites of CHD and T2DM were identified respectively, mainly including alanine, arginine, proline, glutamine, creatinine and acetate.
PMC4965763	A01005	In clinical practice, higher levels of cholesterol in large, triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles, mainly very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and lower levels of cholesterol in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles are known to be associated with increasing risk of CHD_, .
PMC4965763	A01007	Diagnosis of T2DM is typically determined by fasting blood glucose and the oral glucose tolerance test that examines an individual’s ability to dispose of a glucose load.
PMC4965763	A01008	Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) provides information on glucose management during the months preceding the initial testing_, .
PMC4965763	D00008	These metabolites included isoleucine, valine, isopropanol, alanine, leucine, acetate, proline, glutamine, arginine, trans-aconitate, creatine, creatinine, glucose, glycine, threonine, tyrosine and 3-methylhistidine.
PMC4965763	D00010	In our study, four unique metabolic pathways of arginine and proline metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism are identified from T2DM and CHD patients.
PMC4965763	D01000	Glucose is the major source material for ATP production in cells.
PMC4965763	D01001	ATP is mainly produced through metabolism of glucose under normoxia condition, which is composed of three relay pathways: citric acid cycle (TCA cycle, Krebs cycle), oxygen-independent pathway of glucose to pyruvate in cytoplasm and oxygen-dependent electron transfer chain, respectively.
PMC4965763	D01003	The anaerobic glycolysis begins to play a dominant role for ATP production under the conditions of hypoxia, leading to the disorder of glucose.
PMC4965763	D01004	Creatine, synthesized in the liver and kidney, is transported through the blood and taken up by tissues with high energy demands.
PMC4965763	D01006	Creatinine is derived from creatine and phosphocreatine.
PMC4965763	D01007	Creatine has the ability to increase muscle stores of phosphocreatine, potentially increasing the muscle’s ability to resynthesize ATP from ADP to meet increasing energy demands.
PMC4965763	D01008	Therefore, the level of creatine and creatinine also reflect the disorder of energy metabolism in T2DM-CHD patients.
PMC4965763	D02000	Leucine, isoleucine and valine are essential amino acids whose carbon structures are marked by branch points (BCAA).
PMC4965763	D02002	BCAA, especially leucine, can be an important source of calories, and is superior as fuel to the ubiquitous intravenous D-glucose, and it also can stimulate insulin released by pancreatic b-cells in vitro .
PMC4965763	D02005	As the most abundant amino acid in the serum, glutamine is the most important amino acid gluconeogenic precursor for adding new carbon to the glucose pool.
PMC4965763	D02006	Turer et al . used metabolomic profiling to compare cardiac extraction and plasma substrates, and demonstrated that patients with CHD had decreased concentration of glutamate/glutamine.
PMC4965763	D02007	Alanine is highly concentrated in muscle and is one of the most important amino acids released by muscle, functioning as a major energy source.
PMC4965763	D02008	It is an important participant as well as regulator in glucose metabolism, and its levels always parallel blood sugar levels.
PMC4965763	D02009	And reduced concentrations of glutamine and alanine were also observed in T2DM patients, which illustrated the enhancement of gluconeogenesis in the diabetic state.
PMC4965763	D02011	Our results are consistent with previous studies which indicate that the conversion of glutamine and alanine is high in T2DM patients.
PMC4965763	D02012	Karsten Suhre et al . reported that BCAA (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) all increased in the diabetes group, and elevated levels of BCAA have been found up to 13.5 years ahead of clinical manifestation in the study of Walford et al ., Floegel et al . and Wang et al ._, _, , however, there is growing evidence that elevated BCAA levels may reflect a state of insulin resistance that is not necessarily specific to T2DM.
PMC4965763	D02013	Arginine is one of the most versatile amino acids in animal cells, serving as a precursor for the synthesis not only of proteins but also of nitric oxide, urea, polyamines, proline, glutamate, creatine and agmatine.
PMC4965763	D02015	Fu et al . have reported that dietary L-arginine supplementation markedly reduced white-fat mass in Zucker diabetic fatty rats.
PMC4965763	D02016	Isopropanol belongs to the family of alcohols and polyols compounds.
PMC4965763	D02017	The previous report indicated that isopropanol is one of the products from propanoate metabolism, and the substrate for synthesizing acetone catalyzed by the enzyme isopropanol dehydrogenase.
PMC4965763	D02018	Alcohol dehydrogenase oxidizes alcohols to either aldehydes or ketones, with concomitant reduction of NAD_+ to NADH.
PMC4965763	D02019	Thus, we suggested that the isopropanol is associated with acetone metabolism, which may be a significant differential metabolite in T2DM.
PMC4965763	M02003	Plasma samples were thawed and prepared by mixing 200 μL of plasma with 400 μl of 1.5 M of deuterated phosphate buffer (NaH_2 PO_4 and K_2 HPO_4 , including 0.1% TSP, pH 7.47), adding D_2 O up to 600 μL if the volume of serum is insufficient.
PMC4965763	M04001	All the spectra were referenced to the methyl group of lactate at δ1.336.
PMC4965763	M04003	Spectral regions of δ4.68–5.10, δ3.65–3.57, δ3.06–3.23, δ2.66–2.72 and δ2.53–2.60 were excluded to eliminate variations caused by imperfect water suppression, EDTA, and EDTA metal complexes.
PMC4965763	R00001	There was no significant difference in gender, age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pressure (DBP), total cholesterol, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (SCr) among the four groups based on SPSS analysis (p  > 0.05).
PMC4965763	R00002	The level of triglycerides and HbA1c in T2DM and T2DM-CHD was higher than that of the controls (p  < 0.05).
PMC4965763	R00004	As expected, FPG, 2 h plasma glucose (2hPG) and fasting insulin (FINS) in T2DM-CHD and T2DM were higher compared to the controls (p  < 0.05), particularly in T2DM-CHD (p  < 0.0001).
PMC4965763	R00007	BMI: body mass index; SBP: systolic blood pressure; DBP: diastolic blood pressure; LDL: low density lipoproteins; HDL: high density lipoproteins; BUN: blood urea nitrogen; SCr: serum creatinine; HbA1c: glycated hemoglobin; FPG: fasting plasma glucose; 2hPG: 2h plasma glucose; FINS: fasting insulin.
PMC4965763	R01002	The plasma NMR spectra were dominated by LDL/VLDL (δ0.86, δ1.26), leucine (δ0.95, δ0.97), valine (δ1.03), lactate (δ1.33, δ4.12), alanine (δ1.48), acetate (δ1.92), glucose (δ3.2–4.0, 4.66, 5.23) etc.
PMC4965763	R01006	In the _1 H NMR spectral of plasma samples, the dominated change of the signals among low molecular weight metabolites like leucine, isoleucine, valine, alanine, glutamine, creatine, proline, glucose etc. were detected.
PMC4965763	R01008	Distinguished metabolites: 1 VLDL/LDL, 2 leucine, 3 isoleucine, 4 valine, 5 isopropanol, 6 lactate, 7 alanine, 8 acetate, 9 arginine, 10 proline, 11 glutamine, 12 EDTA, 13 creatine, 14 creatinine, 15 glucose, 16 glycine, 17 threonine, 18 serine, 19 tyrosine, 20 3-methylhistidine, 21 formate, 22 acetone.
PMC4965763	R02020	The resonances assigned to proline and creatine were significantly increased, but the levels of isopropanol, alanine, leucine, arginine, acetate, glutamine, glycine, glucose and 3-methylhistidine were statistically decreased in the CHD group compared to those of the HC group.
PMC4965763	R02021	The T2DM group had lower levels of isoleucine, leucine, valine, isopropanol, alanine, arginine, glutamine, proline, creatinine, threonine and tyrosine, but had higher levels of glucose compared to thoes of the HC group.
PMC4965763	R03004	It could be observed that the metabolic state of T2DM-CHD patients resulted in the decreased levels of isopropanol, glycine, alanine, arginine, proline, glutamine, acetate, creatine, 3-methylhistidine, creatinine, isoleucine, tyrosine, valine, threonine and leucine, as well as elevated levels of VLDL/LDL and glucose.
PMC4965763	R04024	The metabolites in included isopropanol, glycine, alanine, arginine, proline, glutamine, acetate, glucose, creatine, 3-methylhistidine, creatinine, isoleucine, tyrosine, valine, threonine and leucine, and the importance decreased in this order, while the VLDL/LDL was rejected as it made little contribution to distinguish the T2DM-CHD and HC.
PMC4965763	R05003	There were 4 pathways disturbed when T2DM-CHD occurred, including arginine and proline metabolism, Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism and Pyruvate metabolism, which included more than one target.
PMC4965763	R05005	(a) Arginine and proline metabolism (b) Glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, (c) Alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, (d) Pyruvate metabolism.

PMC4969426	A00005	Conclusion: Based on metabolomics of GC-MS detection and analysis metabolites can be found differences between type 2 diabetes and healthy control group, PCA diagram can effectively distinguish Type II diabetes and healthy control group, with load diagrams and PLS-DA VIP value metabolite screening, the resulting differences in metabolic pathways involved metabolites, including amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism and energy metabolism.
PMC4969426	D00010	The succinate, L-leucine, L-isoleucine, tyrosine showed a downward trend; alanine, acetyl amine, mannose, l-threonine, phenylalanine, fructose, D-glucose, palmitic acid, oleic acid and arachidonic acid showed rising trend.
PMC4969426	D00011	By analysis of these metabolites, we got the conclusion that these metabolites mainly related to amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism and energy metabolism and other metabolic pathways.
PMC4969426	D00012	The lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glucose metabolism and other metabolic pathways in T2DM patients had different degrees of disorder and affect each other.

For the ion titration experiment, Chelex-treated urine (400 μl), was supplemented with H_2 O containing various concentrations of CaCl_2 , MgCl_2 , NaCl or KCl, ranging from 0 to 1 M, and D_2 O (20 μl) containing DSS to give a final concentration of 0.1 mM. NMR samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 13,000 rpm and 550 μl was transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube.
PMC5025509	R00027	An example of these model fits for one, two and three site protonation models of formate, alanine, and citrate respectively, is shown in Fig.
PMC5025509	R00029	The two pairs of geminal methylene protons of citrate produce a strongly coupled AB spin system in _1 H NMR spectra (Moore and Sillerud ) and the two A and B chemical shifts are shown in Fig.
PMC5025509	R00031	The models closely agree with measured chemical shifts in most cases, although one of the citrate peaks (Fig.
PMC5025509	R00034	As previously described, the urea amide peak at 5.7 ppm, at both high and low pH values is seen to gradually disappear due to enhanced rates of proton exchange at these pH values (Xiao et al. ).
PMC5025509	R00035	Measured chemical shift changes (open circle ) for Formate (a), Alanine (b) and Citrate (c) peaks are shown with non-linear fits to the one, two and three protonation site forms of Eq.
PMC5025509	R00037	A second Citrate peak (d) is shown with a nonlinear fit to the three protonation site form of Eq.
PMC5025509	R00039	 (2) (line ) NMR samples are generally buffered to neutral or near-neutral pH using phosphate buffer, but there is no absolute need for this, and some studies have chosen more extreme sample pH endpoints in order to move away from the pK _a values of highly shifting metabolites (Beneduci et al. ;
PMC5025509	R00050	Working at high pH values would also have the advantage that the signal from the urea peak would be removed or have reduced intensity.
PMC5025509	R00054	We added the metals (as chloride salts) to the ion-exchange-resin-treated urine sample, to final concentrations ranging from 0.01 mM to 1 M.
PMC5025509	R00066	As seen with the pH-induced changes on peak chemical shifts, the largest metal ion-induced peak variations were for the azole-class metabolites histidine, and methyl-histidines.
PMC5025509	R00067	Histidine’s affinity for a number of metal ions is well known (Maley and Mellor ).
PMC5025509	R00072	Good’s buffers, a class of zwitterionic N -substituted aminosulfonic acid buffers, have been considered to have weak metal complexation properties; however some reports suggest that many of these buffers in fact strongly bind metals (Mash et al. ).
PMC5041126	A00003	The exchange solvents were methanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, chloroform, acetone, dichloromethane, and dimethyl formamide.
PMC5041126	A01000	NMR spectroscopy, urine, solvents, methanol, DMSO
PMC5041126	M00003	The residue was mixed with 1000 μL of a deuterated solvent (D_2 O, methanol-d _4 (MeOD), acetonitrile-d _3 (MeCN), dimethyl sulfoxide-d _6 (DMSO), CDCl_3 , acetone-d _6 , dichloromethane-d _2 (DCM), dimethyl formamide-d _7 (DMF)) and shaken for 10 min (neolab Intelli Mixer, program: u1, speed: 85 rpm).
PMC5041126	M00008	The residue was mixed with 810 μL of D_2 O, methanol-d _4 or dimethyl sulfoxide-d _6 and 81 μL of an acid/base/salt solution (0.1 M HCl (aq.), 0.1 M NaOH (aq.), 0.1 M NaHCO_3 (aq.), 0.1 M Na_2 CO_3
PMC5041126	R00001	The used solvents were D_2 O, methanol-d _4 (MeOD), acetonitrile-d _3 (MeCN), dimethyl sulfoxide-d _6 (DMSO), CDCl_3 , acetone-d _6 , dichloromethane-d _2 (DCM), and N ,N -dimethyl formamide-d _7 (DMF).
PMC5041126	R00004	In the polar solvents MeOD, DMSO, and DMF most of the substances could be dissolved and there was only a minor residue in the centrifuge tube.
PMC5041126	R00005	In the remaining solvents MeCN, CDCl_3 , acetone, and DCM nearly no difference to the freshly lyophilized residue could be observed, indicating insufficient solubility of the urine matrix in these solvents.
PMC5041126	R00007	With D_2 O as the solvent, no residual remainders are visible, with MeOD, DMSO, and DMF a minor debris is visible and with MeCN, CDCl_3 , acetone, and DCM nearly no difference to the undissolved sample is visible, indicating substantially incomplete dissolution.
PMC5041126	R00008	Main components in the residue of the polar solvents MeOD, DMSO, and DMF are most likely salts that are only completely soluble in water.
PMC5041126	R00010	It should be noted that even substances with low solubility in organic solvents, like for example alanine, are still readily dissolved as the concentration present in urine is sufficiently low.
PMC5041126	R00012	The evaluated metabolites were hippurate, creatinine, lactate, histidine, and alanine.
PMC5041126	R00013	The only metabolite present in all solvents was hippurate, while creatinine and lactate were found in all solvents but chloroform and dichloromethane.
PMC5041126	R00014	Histidine and alanine were solely found in water, methanol, DMSO, and DMF.
PMC5041126	R00016	Methanol and DMSO show a good reproducibility with relative standard deviations below 7% for methanol and around 10% for DMSO for all metabolites.
PMC5041126	R00017	The last solvent which showed good solubility of the urine matrix, DMF, has a good reproducibility for most of the examined metabolites (relative standard deviation below 10%) but very strong variations in the histidine signal (75%).
PMC5041126	R00018	This is caused by an intensive signal next to the histidine signal that overlaps quite strongly in some samples.
PMC5041126	R00019	Acetonitrile and acetone with at least three of the five evaluated metabolites present, show both strong variations with relative standard deviations of up to 44% for MeCN and 27% for acetone.
PMC5041126	R00020	Although the variations in chloroform and dichloromethane are relatively small, only one of the metabolite was found, eliminating them as suitable solvents in metabolomics-type studies.
PMC5041126	R00024	Comparing the intensity of the integrals to the values in water, it is striking that some integrals are higher in MeOD, DMSO, and DMF as compared to the original urine sample.
PMC5041126	R00027	Given the strong differences for example in methanol (1.3 for hippurate and creatinine and 1.6 for histidine), there must be an effect of the solvents.
PMC5041126	R00029	Indeed, measurement of T_1 times on a separate urine sample lyophylized and redissolved in the various solvents indicates relaxation times larger than 2 s for almost all metabolites investigated in D_2 O, while they are shorter in MeOD, DMSO, and DMF (Figure S1).
PMC5041126	R00030	Considering the applied recovery delay of 4 s and acquisition time of approximately 2.6 s as commonly applied periods in urine NMR studies, insufficient relaxation especially of histidine, hippurate, and creatinine are expected.
PMC5041126	R00033	The signal positions of the metabolites lactate and hippurate seem to be very robust, because there are only minor shifts in the signal position visible.
PMC5041126	R00035	The same trend can be seen for alanine and creatinine but with stronger variations in the signal position within individual solvents.
PMC5041126	R00036	As expected, the biggest variations can be observed in the histidine signal: between solvents, its position shifts over a range of more than 0.7 ppm, while within one solvent, the variation can be up to 0.1 ppm (DMF).
PMC5041126	R00042	(A) histidine; (B) hippurate; (C) creatinine; (D) alanine; (E) lactate.
PMC5041126	R00043	Given the bad solubility of the urine matrix in chloroform and dichloromethane, the big relative standard deviation in acetone and acetonitrile and the large variations in signal positions in DMF, only methanol and DMSO seem to be suitable as solvents for the urine matrix—besides water, of course.
PMC5041126	R00050	While the addition of HCl to the aqueous samples shifts the signals of histidine and creatinine to higher ppm values, it shifts the signals of lactate, alanine, and hippurate to lower ppm values.
PMC5041126	R00051	For hippurate and lactate in MeOD and DMSO matrices instead, the signal positions are always shifted to higher ppm values for all added solutions.
PMC5041126	R00052	Again, the effect is strongest for the very pH-sensitive metabolite histidine which can be observed within an area of 0.54 ppm for water, 0.76 ppm for MeOD, and 0.38 ppm for DMSO.
PMC5041126	R00055	(A) histidine; (B) hippurate; (C): creatinine; (D) alanine; (E) lactate.
PMC5041126	R00061	The only exception that does not fit into this row is acetonitrile.
PMC5041126	R00065	Only when adding the acid/base/salt solutions to DMSO, the shift area is smaller for creatinine and histidine.
PMC5065216	A02000	Higher levels of total physical activity were associated with various metabolite concentrations, including lower concentrations of amino acids and their derivatives, and higher concentrations of pipecolate (FDR p <0.05 in original population).
PMC5065216	A02001	The findings persisted after adjustment for age, body mass index, smoking, alcohol intake, and energy intake.
PMC5065216	A02002	Isoleucine, leucine, valine, 4-methyl-2-oxoisopentanoate, 2-oxoisopentanoate, alanine, and proline concentrations were lower with a shorter sitting time.
PMC5065216	D00005	Concentrations of isoleucine, one of the BCAAs, were higher in the lower daily active groups, consistent with earlier studies.
PMC5065216	D00006	Additionally, leucine and valine were also decreased in the groups with less sitting time.
PMC5065216	D00009	The baseline characteristics in our present study did not show an association between TPA level and plasma glucose or IGT prevalence, however, this might have been due to the cross-sectional design of the study.
PMC5065216	D00014	In our study, 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate and 2-oxoisopentanoate, branched-chain alpha-keto acids (BCKAs) derived from leucine and valine, respectively, showed similar trends to BCAAs.
PMC5065216	D00016	Furthermore, plasma BCKA level is reported to be a predictive biomarker for T2D and impaired fasting glucose.
PMC5065216	D00017	BCAAs are first converted to BCKAs in mitochondria, which are in turn used in the production of acylcarnitines.
PMC5065216	D00019	Concentrations of alanine and proline, which are known as glycogenic amino acids, were higher in our inactive groups.
PMC5065216	D00020	In the fasting state, plasma glucose level is mainly maintained by glycogenolysis (glycogen breakdown) and glycogenesis (synthesis of glucose from glucogenic amino acids).
PMC5065216	D00021	Alanine and proline are involved in glycogenesis through pathways of the glucose-alanine cycle (Cahill cycle) and tricarboxylic acid cycle, respectively.
PMC5065216	D00024	These findings help illustrate the contribution of physical activity to glucose homeostasis.
PMC5065216	D00028	Moreover, the results remained unchanged after adjustment for potential confounders, including BMI, smoking, alcohol, and energy intake, and after replication analysis, and are coherent with previous epidemiological studies [,].
PMC5065216	D00037	In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that physical activity, in terms of both TPA and sedentary behavior, is associated with polar plasma metabolic profiles as quantified by metabolomics, especially for BCAAs and BCKAs, alanine and proline.
PMC5065216	M01001	The participants responded to a self-administered questionnaire which included information on physical activity, demographic factors, alcohol drinking, smoking habit, personal medical history, and other lifestyle factors.
PMC5065216	M01003	Other measurements included height and weight to calculate body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and routine blood tests conducted in the check-up, including serum triglyceride, cholesterols, hemoglobin A1c, and plasma glucose.
PMC5065216	M01004	Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90 mmHg and/or currently on antihypertensive therapy; impaired glucose tolerance as fasting plasma glucose ≥ 110mg mg/dL and/or hemoglobin A1c (NGSP) ≥ 6.5% and/or current use of antidiabetic medication; and dyslipidemia as serum triglyceride ≥ 150 mg/dL and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 140 mg/dL and/or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≤ 40 mg/dL and/or current use of antidyslipidemic medication.
PMC5065216	M04007	Age, body mass index (BMI), smoking (never/former/current), alcohol intake (none/current), daily dietary energy intake without alcohol (higher/lower than median) were then included as potential confounders for adjusted analysis.
PMC5065216	R00002	In the original population, participants in the Q4 group reported the highest alcohol intake and current smoking.

PMC5065216	R01002	isoleucine, leucine, and valine (age-adjusted r = 0.84).
PMC5065216	R01004	Concentrations of 13 plasma metabolites showed linear trends with relation to TPA level in the original dataset even after adjustment for multiplicity (FDR p <0.05), of which concentrations of five (isoleucine, 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate, alanine, proline, and pipecolate) were replicated.
PMC5065216	R01005	Among these five metabolites, the concentrations of four (isoleucine, proline, alanine, and 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate) were decreased in the higher active TPA group and were increased for pipecolate.
PMC5065216	R01006	The results were consistent with the inclusion or exclusion of various potential confounders, namely age, BMI, alcohol intake, smoking status, or dietary intake.
PMC5065216	R01007	In addition to our findings for these metabolites, our results also show the known associations of higher HDL-cholesterol and lower triglyceride concentration with physical activity.

PMC5065216	R02001	Isoleucine, leucine, valine, alanine and proline showed a decrease with shorter sitting time in both the original and replication analysis.
PMC5065216	R02002	4-Methyl-2-oxopentanoate and 2-oxoisopentanoate showed similar trends.

PMC5065216	R03004	Multivariable-adjusted (age, BMI, smoking, alcohol, energy intake) mean concentrations were calculated by groups cross-classified by TPA level and sitting time.
PMC5073280	A00004	Uni and multivariate analyses of metabolites identified in urine by _1 H NMR revealed 11 deregulated molecules in ARD subjects and involved in phenylalanine, histidine, arginine and proline metabolism.
PMC5073280	A00005	Despite contribution of confounding factors like exposure period, dietary factors including smoking and alcohol status, our results demonstrate existence of exposure specific metabotypes in biofluids of ARD, OW and TC groups.
PMC5073280	D00020	ARDs not only showed the highest levels of oxidative stress in terms of ROS and lipid peroxidase activity but also had the lowest proportion of catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity.
PMC5073280	D00039	It is important to note that higher molecular abundance of 2-hydroxy valerate, histidine and cis-aconitic acid were observed in both ARD and TC groups with respect to OW.

PMC5073280	D00048	Increased cresol level in urine of ARD subjects may be due to altered gut microbiome diversity or different food habits or both.
PMC5073280	D00049	Amide derivative of glycine and para-aminobenozoic acid leads to formation of p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) and increased levels of it in ARD may show impaired renal function.
PMC5073280	D00050	Higher elimination of phenylalanine in urine of ARD may also reduce catecholamine production and that may interfere with the antioxidant repair mechanism.
PMC5073280	D00051	Benzoate was one of the compounds first found to be elevated in urine of patients with intestinal bacterial over growth of various origins.
PMC5073280	D00052	And bacterial catabolism of dietary polyphenols may be the predominant origin of benzoate, which is normally conjugated with glycine in the liver to form hippurate.
PMC5073280	D00053	Abnormalities of urinary benzoate and hippurate may reveal clinically significant detoxification or dysbiosis issues.
PMC5073280	D00054	Higher benzoate in urine of ARD indicates poor detoxification via phase II glycine conjugation.
PMC5073280	D00062	We measured metabolic and other physiological details to explain the oxidative stress but due to operational challenges, individual exposure monitoring to pollutants such as NOx, CO, PM or PAH and noise disturbance were not accounted for in this study.

PMC5218495	D01013	Studies have shown that polyphenols (epigalocatechin gallate, oenothelin B, ellagitanin, and resveratrol) augment NK cell cytotoxicity [–]; however, a study of hesperidin showed no effects in healthy, well-nourished humans.
PMC5218495	D01014	In an in vitro study, INF-γ concentrations were increased after treatment with resveratrol; however, because the study was done in a cell culture system, release of INF-γ was likely the result of NK cell activation.

PMC5218495	R01000	CE-TOFMS and LC-TOFMS analyses identified seven low-molecular-weight phenolic acids in the FPP; we did not detect significant levels of homovanillic and m-phenolic acid in FPP fermented for less than one year.
PMC5218495	R01001	In addition to those listed in , we identified several other types of organic acids such as lactic acid, various amino acids, and nucleic acids.
PMC5250582	A00001	This non-targeted lipidomics CTS approach was applied in both positive and negative ion mode to phospholipids present in human serum and the data set was used to evaluate the value of product ion mobility in identifying lipids in a complex mixture.
PMC5250582	M00000	Lipid ester standards (PC(17:0/20:4), PE(17:0/20:4), PA(17:0/20:4), PS(17:0/20:4), PI(17:0/20:4), and SM(d18:1/18:0)) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL).
PMC5250582	M00004	Polyalanine was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis MO).
PMC5250582	M01001	The serum was diluted to 0.4 mL with HBSS followed by the addition of 1 mL of methanol and 0.5 mL of chloroform to make a monophase.
PMC5250582	M01002	After vortexing and sonication, an additional 0.4 mL of HBSS and 0.5 mL of chloroform was added to create a biphasic solution.

PMC5250582	M03005	The total product ion mass spectra obtained from the positive and negative ion CTS experiments were mass measured using the abundant product ion from PC lipids at m/z 184.0734 in positive mode and the abundant product ion from 18:2 fatty acid containing phospholipids at m/z 279.2329 in negative ion mode as lock mass calibrants.
PMC5250582	M05001	The centroided ion mobility times were converted into CCS using previously published protocols_, with polyalanine (0.1 ng/µL) as a calibrant and are expressed in square Angstrom (Å_2 ).
PMC5250582	M05004	The drift times of the product and precursor ions did change with the different T-wave velocity, T-wave height, and IMS gas flow rate values, however the CCS values of the product and precursor ions obtained using polyalanine oligomers as a calibrant did not change.
PMC5250582	R00001	From the CTS dataset all tandem mass spectral analysis strategies such as precursor and product ion data could be extracted as well as complete MS/MS spectra for each phospholipid under investigation.
PMC5250582	R00003	Phospholipids can be analyzed as either positive or negative molecular ions and CID of these molecular ions yields different information relevant to the nature of the intact precursor ion species and product ions.
PMC5250582	R00004	For example, CID of [M+H]_+ of phospholipids yields product ions related to the polar headgroup while the most abundant product ions derived from CID of the [M−H]_− of phospholipids correspond to the carboxylate anions and loss of a neutral fatty acid or ketene from one or both of the fatty acyl chains.
PMC5250582	R00005	The product ion mobilities in both positive and negative ion mode are very different from that of the precursor phospholipid ions, which is not only due to the lower m/z of the product ions, but also because the product ions tend to have more compact structures.
PMC5250582	R00006	The current study focused on the ion mobility of lipid product ions in negative and positive ion mode and the value of using ion mobility of product ions to identify phospholipids in a complex mixture.
PMC5250582	R00007	Negative ion CTS analysis of phospholipid standards (PC, PE, PA, PS, and PI) containing heptadecanoic acid (17:0) esterified to the sn -1 position of the glycerol backbone and arachidonic acid (20:4) at the sn -2 position of the glycerol backbone and the sphingomyelin standard, SM(d18:1/18:0), was completed.
PMC5250582	R00008	In the CTS analysis of phospholipid standards, the ions with largest CCS ranging from 271 to 303 Å_2 corresponded to the molecular ion [M−H]_− for PA, PI, PE, and PS and the [M−15]_− ion for PC and SM.
PMC5250582	R00009	Even though each of the phospholipid standards has 17:0 at the sn -1 position and 20:4 esterified to sn -2 position of the glycerol backbone, different ion mobility was observed for each lipid class molecular ion due to the size and shape of the polar headgroup.
PMC5250582	R00010	Additionally, in the CTS analysis of PS(17:0/20:4) a product ion at m/z 709, which corresponded to the neutral loss of serine (87 Da), was observed and the resultant product ion had the same structure as the molecular ion of PA and therefore same CCS of 271 Å_2 .
PMC5250582	R00011	The dominant product ions in the CID spectra of each of these phospholipid standards obtained during the negative ion CTS analysis were at m/z 269 and 303, which corresponded to the carboxylate anions of 17:0 and 20:4.
PMC5250582	R00013	Ion mobilograms of the precursor and product ions obtained from negative ion CTS of (A) PC(17:0/20:4), (B) PE(17:0/20:4), (C) PA(17:0/20:4), (D) PS(17:0/20:4), (E) PI(17:0/20:4), and (F) SM(d18:1/18:0).
PMC5250582	R00016	Another common fragmentation pathway observed in the phospholipid standards during the negative ion CTS experiment corresponded to the loss of one fatty acid from the glycerol backbone.
PMC5250582	R00018	Specifically, the loss of arachidonic acid from the sn -2 position of the glycerol backbone as a neutral ketene [M−H−R_2 C=O]_− was observed leading to the 17:0 lyso product ion with a product ion mobility ranging from 206 to 239 Å_2 , depending on the headgroup of the lipid standard.
PMC5250582	R00019	Additionally, another product ion that had CCS value in between that of the molecular ion and the fatty acids described above was observed in the negative ion CTS experiment of PI at m/z 567 and in PA and PS standards at m/z 405.
PMC5250582	R00020	These fragment ions correspond to the loss of arachidonic acid as a free carboxylic acid from the sn -2 position of PI [M−H−R_2 COO]_− with a CCS of 236 Å_2 and loss of AA from the sn -2 position of PA [M−H−R_2 COO]_− and PS [M−H−87−R_2 COO]_− with a CCS of 200 Å_2 .
PMC5250582	R00021	Additionally, the negative ion CTS experiment of the SM(d18:1/18:0) standard revealed a product ion at m/z 449 with a CCS of 217 Å_2 that arises via cleavage of the amide bond and neutral loss of the 18:0 fatty acid.
PMC5250582	R00022	The negative ion CTS analysis of PI, PA, PS, PE, and SM standards also revealed product ions with low CCS values.
PMC5250582	R00023	For PI, the product ion with a low CCS of 134 Å_2 corresponded to the characteristic cyclic phosphodiester of inositol (m/z 241), which is unique for PI lipids.
PMC5250582	R00024	In the CTS analysis of PA and PS, the product ion at m/z 153, which is a 1,2-cyclic phosphodiester of glycerol, had low CCS value of 108 Å_2 .
PMC5250582	R00025	This product ion at m/z 153 is observed in the CID of the [M−H]_− of all phospholipids at high collision energy (~50 V), however the current analyses were performed at a collision energy of 35 V and this product ion was only observed in the PA and PS standards.
PMC5250582	R00026	The CTS analysis of PE in negative ion mode resulted in a product ion at m/z 196 with a CCS value of 130 Å_2 .
PMC5250582	R00027	This product ion is a diagnostic ion present in the CID of PE lipids in the negative ion mode and corresponds to a dehydrated phosphoethanolamine anion.
PMC5250582	R00028	Finally, in the negative ion CTS analysis of the SM standard, the major product ion occurred at m/z 168, which corresponds to the N-dimethylaminoethylphosphate anion with a CCS value of 125 Å_2 .
PMC5250582	R00031	In order to determine if the identification of phospholipids within a complex biological sample can be confirmed with increased confidence by evaluation of the ion mobility (CCS) of the product ions, negative ion CTS analysis of the Bligh Dyer extract of human serum was performed.
PMC5250582	R00033	The abundant precursor ions present in the negative ion CTS experiment corresponded to the [M−15]_− of PC molecular species from m/z 700–800 Da as well as the acetate adducts of PC as [M+OAc]_− and the [M−H]_− of PI molecular species from m/
PMC5250582	R00035	The carboxylate anion of linoleic acid at m/z 279 was the most abundant product ion in the CTS total product ion spectrum along with other carboxylate anions derived from palmitic (m/z 255), oleic (m/z 281) and arachidonic acid (m/z 303).
PMC5250582	R00036	Another fragment ion observed in the CTS total product ion spectrum occurred at m/z 241, which is the cyclic phosphodiester of inositol.
PMC5250582	R00037	The molecular ions of the phospholipids in the human serum sample were not observed in the CTS total product ion spectrum due to the higher collision energy used for these experiments.
PMC5250582	R00038	The total ion mobilogram of the product ions observed in the negative ion CTS experiment had an abundant peak originating from the carboxylate anion of linoleic acid at a CCS value of 175 Å_2 .
PMC5250582	R00044	Extraction of precursors of m/z 279.233±10 ppm from the negative ion CTS data revealed phospholipids containing linoleic acid including the [M−15]_− and [M+OAc]_− of PC(16:0 /18:2) at m/z 742 and 816, [M−15]_− and [M+OAc]_− of PC(18:0/18:2) at m/z 770 and 844, and the [M−H]_− of PI(18:0/18:2) at m/z 861 (.
PMC5250582	R00047	The phospholipid molecular species present in human serum containing linoleic acid could also be extracted using their unique product ion CCS of 175 Å_2 .
PMC5250582	R00050	While the product ion CCS and precursor ion extracted data were very similar for the identification of phospholipids containing linoleic acid in human serum, the product ion CCS became a valuable filter when the precursors of other product ions of less abundant lipids are extracted from the negative ion CTS data.
PMC5250582	R00052	For example, the product ion at m/z 168.043 (N-dimethylaminoethylphosphate anion) is a CID product of all SM lipids as described above.
PMC5250582	R00056	The resultant plot was simplified when the data was filtered in two dimensions for both precursors of m/z 168.043±10 ppm and precursors of product ions with a CCS of 125±1 Å_2 and enabled for the identification of six SM molecular species including SM(d18:1/16:0) at m/z 687, SM(d18:1/18:0) at m/z 715, SM(d18:1/20:0) at m/z 743, SM(d18:1/22:0) at m/z 771, and SM(d18:1/24:1) at m/z 797.
PMC5250582	R00058	Additionally, the value of filtering the negative ion CTS data in two dimensions for both product ion m/z (241.012±10 ppm) and product ion CCS (134±1 Å_2 ) was further demonstrated with phosphatidylinositol lipids in human serum and allowed for the identification of PI(16:0/18:2) at m/z 833, PI(16:0/20:4) at m/z 857, PI(18:0/18:2) at m/z 861, and PI(18:0/20:4) at m/z 885 from the negative ion CTS data.
PMC5250582	R00061	The ions at m/z 687, 715, 743, 771, and 797 were identified as SM(d18:1/16:0), SM(d18:1/18:0), SM(d18:1/20:0), SM(d18:1/22:0), and SM(d18:1/24:1), respectively.
PMC5250582	R00064	The overwhelming majority of glycerophospholipid in human serum is PC and the abundant precursor ions present in the positive ion CTS experiment correspond to the major PC and lyso PC species found in serum.
PMC5250582	R00065	When the positive ion CTS data was filtered in two dimensions specifically for PC lipids (precursors of m/z 184.073±10 ppm and precursors of product ions with a CCS value of 132±1 Å_2 ), the data looks very similar to the individual extractions.
PMC5250582	R00066	While the product ion CCS and precursor ion extracted data were very similar for the identification of abundant PC molecular ions in serum, the product ion CCS does become a useful filter for phospholipids present in lower abundance in the serum sample.
PMC5250582	R00067	Some of the lower abundance product ions observed in the positive ion CTS of serum are derived from PE plasmalogen lipids, which result in an abundant product ion that provides information about the acyl chain esterified sn -2 position of the glycerol backbone in positive ion mode.
PMC5250582	R00068	When the positive ion CTS data was filtered in two dimensions specifically for PE plasmalogens containing AA (precursors of m/z 361.274±10 ppm and precursors of product ions with a CCS value of 197±1 Å_2 ), the resultant plot is simplified compared to only filtering in one dimension and allowed for the identification of an AA containing lyso PE, PE(OH/20:4) at m/z 502, and three AA containing plasmalogen PE lipids, PE(16:0p/20:4) at m/z 724, PE(18:0p/20:4) at m/z 752, and PE(20:0p/20:4) at m/z 780 from the positive ion CTS data.
PMC5250582	R00069	Additionally, similar results were obtained for PE plasmalogens containing DHA.
PMC5287439	A02003	Increased levels of tRNA-specific modified nucleosides (N2,N2-dimethylguanosine, N1-methylinosine), tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (malate, fumarate), glutamate, fatty acid acylcarnitines, tryptophan, and polyamine metabolites and decreased levels of steroids, sphingomyelins, and phosphatidylcholines distinguished patients from control subjects.
PMC5287439	A05007	Evidence of abnormal oxidation, arginine, and sphingosine pathways has been found from mass spectrometry analysis of lung tissue from patients with PAH,_, and analysis of breath samples showed that exhaled volatile compounds discriminate between patients with severe idiopathic PAH and healthy volunteers.
PMC5287439	A05008	A targeted analysis of 105 circulating plasma metabolites in PAH, primarily amino acids, nucleosides, and their derivatives, showed that abnormal levels of tryptophan, purine, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites correlated to hemodynamic measures.
PMC5287439	D01000	Two of the most robust distinguishing and prognostic differences identified in patients with PAH were increased levels of N1-methylinosine and N2,N2-dimethylguanosine.
PMC5287439	D01001	These are recognized epigenetic, posttranscriptional modifications of tRNA,_– and other tRNA modifications also found to be increased and prognostic included pseudouridine, N6-carbamoylthreonyladenosine and N1-methyladenosine.
PMC5287439	D01002	N2,N2-dimethylguanosine is found in the majority of tRNAs at position 26, upstream of the anticodon sequence at positions 34 to 36, and promotes the folding of tRNAs toward the classical cloverleaf structure.
PMC5287439	D01003	N1-methylinosine is found 3′ adjacent to the anticodon at position 37 of eukaryotic tRNAs and is formed from inosine by a specific S-adenosylmethionine–dependent methylase.
PMC5287439	D01004	Increased serum and urine levels of N2,N2-dimethylguanosine, as well as pseudouridine and 1-methylinosine, have been observed in multiple solid tumor malignancies and may reflect the general upregulation of the translational apparatus, including tRNA turnover, in hyperproliferative cancerous cells.
PMC5287439	D01005	Increased circulating 1-methyladenosine has also been shown to be an early indicator of oxidative stress, cell damage, and mortality in kidney disease.
PMC5287439	D02000	Significant alterations were observed in several pathways related to cellular energy production, with accumulation of multiple acylcarnitines, glutamate, and TCA cycle intermediates.
PMC5287439	D02002	Glutaminolysis is another alternative energy production pathway to glucose oxidation, with the product glutamate entering the TCA cycle as α-ketoglutarate.
PMC5287439	D02003	Inhibition of glutaminolysis and restoration of glucose oxidation have beneficial effects in rat models of right ventricular hypertrophy.
PMC5287439	D02004	Increased circulating glutamate levels have previously been seen in cancer patients; however, antiglutaminolysis therapeutic targets have demonstrated toxic side effects.
PMC5287439	D02005	The buildup of TCA intermediates and the precursors to the molecules that enter the cycle (acylcarnitines and glutamate) may indicate dysfunction of this cycle, or at least the inability to keep pace with the demands of the most active cells such as proliferating pulmonary vascular cells.
PMC5287439	D02006	Increased levels of citrate, succinate, and fatty acid metabolites have been demonstrated in lung tissue from patients with PAH, suggesting that dysfunctional energy metabolism is a feature of the diseased tissue.
PMC5287439	D02007	Restoration of glucose oxidation by dichloroacetate therapy is under investigation as a treatment for PAH (ClinicalTrials.gov.
PMC5287439	D02008	Unique identifier: NCT01083524), and maximizing the capacity of the TCA cycle to process the acetyl-CoA produced may be a complementary therapeutic approach.
PMC5287439	D02009	Consistent with previous reports, we found a significant increase in the circulating levels of long-chain acylcarnitines (oleoylcarnitine) and short-chain (myristoylcarnitine, acetylcarnitine, hydroxbutyrylcarnitine) and medium-chain (adipoylcarnitine, suberoylcarnitine) products.
PMC5287439	D02010	The accumulation of acylcarnitines may itself be detrimental, effecting cardiac electrophysiological changes and arrhythmias.
PMC5287439	D02011	There is also increasing evidence that accumulation of long-chain acylcarnitines may contribute to insulin resistance, which is itself common and associated with prognosis in PAH.
PMC5287439	D03000	Multiple sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine lipid species were significantly reduced in patients with PAH, relating to increased mortality.
PMC5287439	D03001	Sphingomyelins are the most abundant subclass of sphingolipids, with other subclasses including sphinogosines, ceramides, and glycophospholipids.
PMC5287439	D03002	In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, low plasma levels of several sphingomyelins relate to disease severity.
PMC5287439	D03003	As a membrane constituent, sphingomyelins are implicated in transmembrane signaling and are generated from phosphatidylcholine and ceramide by sphingomyelin synthase, the knockout of which leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced insulin release.
PMC5287439	D03004	Sphingomyelins may also be considered a source of ceramide, which directly (and indirectly through other active lipid products) regulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell migration, and autophagy.
PMC5287439	D03005	Reduced lineoyl-glycerophosphocholine has been shown to be an early marker of insulin resistance in nondiabetics, and decreased circulating levels of several phosphatidylcholines were seen in patients with severe heart failure.
PMC5287439	D03006	Phospholipids are also sources of multiple cellular signaling molecules, including eicosanoids such as prostacyclin, levels of which are known to be reduced in pulmonary hypertension, with replacement an established treatment option.
PMC5287439	D03007	Circulating levels of DHEA-S and its metabolites (androsterone, epiandrosterone, and androstenediol/4-androsten-3β, 17β-diol disulfate) were reduced in patients with PAH compared with healthy control subjects, consistent with a recent report of reduced circulating levels of DHEA-S in a small cohort of 23 male patients with PAH compared with healthy control subjects.
PMC5287439	D03008	Differences in DHEA-S between patients with PAH and control subjects were independent of the more subtle effects of both sex and age (Figure III in the online-only Data Supplement), and lower DHEA-S levels were independently associated with mortality.
PMC5287439	D03009	Treatment with DHEA or DHEA-S has repeatedly been shown to prevent and reverse pulmonary hypertension in experimental rat models, with clinical trials ongoing in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease–associated pulmonary hypertension (ClinicalTrials.gov.
PMC5287439	D03011	We found increased levels of a breakdown product of N1-acetylspermidine, acisoga.
PMC5287439	D03012	Other metabolites of polyamine metabolism (4-acetamidobutanoate and N-acetylputrescine) were increased in PAH in relation to bilirubin levels and were prognostic in 2 distinct PAH cohorts, independently of established prognostic markers.
PMC5287439	D03014	Administration of monocrotaline to rats led to significantly increased levels of polyamines and the development of pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy, which could be prevented by the administration of an inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, suggesting that these molecules may be novel therapeutic targets.
PMC5287439	D03015	In our study, we validated findings of elevated circulating tryptophan metabolites with increased C-glycosyltryptophan and kynurenine in patients with PAH compared with healthy control subjects, but changes in kynurenine were related to increased bilirubin levels and liver dysfunction.
PMC5287439	D03016	Levels of tryptophan and its other major metabolite, serotonin, were not significantly altered in our analysis.
PMC5287439	D05000	Increased circulating modified nucleosides (N2,N2-dimethylguanosine, N1-methylinosine), TCA cycle intermediates (malate, fumarate), glutamate, fatty acid acylcarnitines, and polyamine metabolites and decreased levels of steroids, sphingomyelins, and phosphatidylcholines are characteristics of patients with PAH that distinguish them from symptomatic patients without pulmonary hypertension.
PMC5287439	M03006	In the disease control and PAH cohorts, preserved renal function was defined as creatinine <75 µmol/L, and preserved liver function was defined as bilirubin
PMC5287439	R00006	Of these metabolites, 53 distinguished healthy control and PAH subjects after correction for potential confounders, including age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, creatinine, bilirubin, and drug therapies (P <0.05; Table I in the online-only Data Supplement and Figure ).
PMC5287439	R00016	These “PAH-specific” differences in metabolites included increases in purine, polyamine, and TCA cycle metabolites and decreases in phosphocholines and sphingomyelins (Figure A), with network analysis showing the importance of hub metabolites N2,N2-dimethylguanosine and malate (Figure B).

PMC5287439	R01001	We found that 7 of 53 metabolites—dehydroisoandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), methionine sulfone, N1-methylinosine, oleoylcarnitine, palmitoylcholine, sphingomyelin (d18:1/20:0, d16:1/22:0)*, and X-24513—independently distinguished patients with PAH (19–70 years of age) and healthy subjects in the discovery analysis with 90% accuracy in an orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis
PMC5287439	R01010	Four of the 20 PAH-specific metabolites—N-acetylaspartate, octadecanedioate, palmitoylcholine, and X-13737—distinguished patients with PAH and disease control subjects with 83% accuracy in the discovery analysis (R _2 =0.49, Q_2 =0.47).
PMC5287439	R02004	After correcting for creatinine and diuretic use, no other potentially confounding factor was associated with survival.
PMC5287439	R02005	Of the 686 well-quantified metabolites, 640 met the assumptions of Cox regression analysis, and 62 of these were prognostic after accounting for creatinine and diuretic use in both analyses.
PMC5287439	R02008	Thirty-six of 62 of the metabolites were independent of these measures (P <0.05; Figure A and Table II in the online-only Data Supplement), and network analysis indicated 2 main clusters with hub metabolites, including again, among others, N2,N2-dimethylguanosine (Figure B).

PMC5314995	A03000	Radiation exposure caused significant perturbations in lipid metabolism, affecting all major lipid species, including free fatty acids, glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids and esterified sterols.
PMC5314995	A03002	Metabolomics profiling indicated an increase in the levels of amino acids, carnitine, and purine metabolites in the serum of NHPs exposed to 10 Gy radiation, suggesting perturbations to protein digestion/absorption, biological oxidations, and fatty acid β-oxidation.
PMC5314995	D00002	Interestingly, the levels of three polyunsaturated TGs (TG 60:10, 60:11, 62:14) significantly increased at 10 Gy.
PMC5314995	D00003	These TGs contained primarily 20:4 (arachidonic acid) and 22:6 (docosahexaenoic acid) acyl moieties.
PMC5314995	D00004	As 20:4 and 22:6 FFAs are involved in inflammation through the COX and LOX pathways, it is possible these TGs are synthesized at an increased rate and serve as a reservoir in the 10 Gy group for possible transport to tissues.
PMC5314995	D00005	It has previously been hypothesized that increased TG concentration could be attributed to lowered TG uptake due to decreased adipose LPL activity, destruction of cell membranes, or increased release from tissues.
PMC5314995	D00008	Past reports have found decreases of TGs and GPs up to 6 days post-IR, but levels began to increase at day 12; however, when compared to a diet control group, TG concentration was higher.
PMC5314995	D00013	LysoPCs may be inflammation markers due to enzymatic release by phospholipases (e.g ., PLA2) that free PUFAs that can be oxidized into eicosanoids.
PMC5314995	D00014	Further investigation by tandem MS showed the more unsaturated molecules increasing due to IR exposure were composed of 20:4 and 22:6 acyl moieties.
PMC5314995	D00015	These polyunsaturated acyls were esterified to ChoEs as well as TGs and GPs.
PMC5314995	D00016	Unlike free cholesterol that is a predominant membrane component, ChoEs may function similarly to TGs as they are used for transport in plasma or as inert storage molecules.
PMC5314995	D00017	While 20:4 and 22:6 acyls are found in esterified form (PC, TG, and ChoE) in higher concentrations at 10 Gy, the active FFA forms increased at 10 Gy but not as high a fold change as esterified forms.
PMC5314995	D00018	FFA (20:4) (arachidonic acid) is an essential PUFA derived from FFA (18:2) (linoleic acid), usually esterified for storage, and cleaved from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2.
PMC5314995	D00019	Upon cleavage, FFA (20:4) is the parent molecule from which many prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and other inflammatory molecules are produced.
PMC5314995	D00020	FFA (22:6) (docosahexaenoic acid) is derived from FFA (22:5) (eicosapentaenoic acid) and inhibits angiogenesis, inflammation, apoptosis, and tumor growth.
PMC5314995	D00021	FFA (22:6) forms resolvins and neuroprotectins through the LOX pathway.
PMC5314995	D00022	Increases in esterified 20:4 and 22:6 likely indicate upregulation of these compounds for transport to tissues or as signaling molecules in lethal/sublethal doses of IR exposure.
PMC5314995	D00025	Changes in water-soluble metabolites suggested perturbations to amino acid/protein metabolism, fatty acid β-oxidation, purine catabolism, and biological oxidations.
PMC5314995	D00026	The concentration of three amino acids (proline, valine, and tyrosine) decreased in animals exposed to IR.
PMC5314995	D00028	While many amino acids increased in mouse/rat serum 24 hours after 8 Gy IR exposure, proline, valine, and tyrosine slightly decreased, although not significantly.
PMC5314995	D00029	Low valine and tyrosine levels may indicate kidney damage, which is a well-known symptom of radiation exposure.
PMC5314995	D00030	Furthermore, biomarkers of renal failure (i.e ., kynurenic acid and xanthurenic acid) were elevated in NHP urine from the same study animals.
PMC5314995	D00031	Three well established biomarkers of radiation exposure (_L -carnitine, taurine, and hypoxanthine) were detected in the present study.
PMC5314995	D00032	Free _L -carnitine and acylcarnitines exhibit high fold changes indicating radiation exposure (; ; ; ).
PMC5314995	D00033	We found a dose dependent increase in _L -carnitine, as in other studies, suggesting perturbation of fatty acid β-oxidation.
PMC5314995	D00034	The majority of _L -carnitine is likely being eliminated from the body, as a 66.2-fold increase was found in urine between control and 10 Gy, but only a 2.1-fold increase is observed in serum.
PMC5314995	D00035	Increased _L -carnitine could also be a clinical sign of muscle wasting or decreased nutrition.
PMC5314995	D00036	The detection of hypoxanthine and uridine indicate perturbations to purine/pyrimidine catabolism.
PMC5314995	D00037	Hypoxanthine slightly increased at 2 Gy but decreased at higher IR exposures, which has been observed in the urine of male human patients.
PMC5314995	D00038	In NHP urine, hypoxanthine increased suggesting elimination at day 7.
PMC5314995	D00039	Uridine is a glycosylated form of uracil and is a nitrogenous base found in RNA.
PMC5314995	D00040	At shorter time points after exposure to IR (e.g ., 24 h) the deaminated form of uridine (2’-deoxyuridine) is found in higher concentrations compared to controls in urine.
PMC5314995	D00041	The decrease in hypoxanthine, slight increase in uridine, and the absence of 2’-deoxyuridine may indicate direct products from IR exposure are being eliminated and cellular activity is occurring at day 7.
PMC5314995	D00047	In particular, we found that lipids rich in polyunsaturated acyls (20:4 [arachidonic acid] and 22:6 [docosahexaenoic acid]) were increased in NHPs exposed to 10 Gy IR.
PMC5314995	D00052	As arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid are important molecules directly involved in pro-inflammatory responses through the COX and LOX pathways, the role of these molecules should be further elucidated in NHPs exposed to high levels of IR (e.g ., 10 Gy).
PMC5314995	M00001	Standards for lipidomics included phosphatidylethanolamine (PE 14:0/14:0), phosphatidylcholine (PC 14:0/14:0), lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC 17:1), cholesterol, cholesteryl ester (ChoE 19:0) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc., Alabaster, AL), TG (19:1/19:1/19:1), diacylglyceride (DG 20:1/20:1), monoacylglyceride (MG 17:1), and free fatty acid (FFA 17:1) (Nu-check Prep Inc., Elysian, MN).

PMC5314995	M02007	Leucine enkephalin (556.2771 [M+H]_+ or 554.2615 [M-H]_− ) was used to calibrate accurate mass on both instruments.

PMC5314995	M04007	For FFAs and ChoEs the normalized values from Progenesis QI were used for statistical analysis.
PMC5314995	R00005	Lipid molecules contributing to the highest variation on the MDS plot generated by RF analysis were identified as PCs (32:2, 32:3, 36:5, 42:6), ePC (32:2), DG (36:4), and TG (58:7).

PMC5314995	R00014	NHP serum contained high levels of 34 and 36 C DG species, of which DG (36:3) was present in the highest abundance.
PMC5314995	R00016	NHP serum contained high levels of TG species ranging from 50–62 C, and the highest abundant TG species consisted of 52 and 54 C.
PMC5314995	R00017	The levels of TGs were higher in control samples, except for select long-chain TGs (TGs [60:10, 60:11, 62:14]), whose levels were in much higher concentrations in animals exposed to 10 Gy IR.
PMC5314995	R00020	A general decrease in short-chain TG, PC, and ePC is observed with high increases in their long-chain structures at 10 Gy exposure.
PMC5314995	R00021	Lysophospholipids increased after radiation exposure.
PMC5314995	R00023	The levels of selected species of ChoE (18:1, 20:4, 22:6) were significantly higher at 10 Gy.
PMC5314995	R00024	There were significant changes in the levels of FFAs (18:3, 22:6, and 20:4) due to IR exposure.
PMC5314995	R00026	Control samples had significantly lower levels of FFA (22:6) than the 10 Gy group.

PMC5314995	R00031	To further elucidate the chemical structure of TG and GP species that were increased at 10 Gy in response to IR exposure, we analyzed their fragmentation patterns using quadrupole mass filtered tandem MS spectra.
PMC5314995	R00032	We identified PC (38:2; 18:0/20:2), PC (38:3; 18:0/20:3), PC (38:6; 16:0/22:6), PC (38:4; 18:0/20:4), TG (60:10; 18:0/20:4/22:6), TG (60:11; 18:1/20:4/22:6), and TG (62:14; 18:2/22:6/22:6 and 20:4/20:4/22:6).
PMC5314995	R01001	When the KEGG, BioCyc, and Reactome databases were searched by putative significant ions, perturbations were observed in the valine biosynthesis/degradation (2, 4, 7, 10 Gy; KEGG# ko00290), tyrosine biosynthesis/degradation (4 Gy; BioCyc# PWY-6134, TYRFUMCAT-PWY), citrulline biosynthesis (7 Gy; BioCyc# PWY-5004, CITRULBIO-PWY), protein digestion/absorption (4, 7, 10 Gy; KEGG# ko04974), biological oxidations (4, 10 Gy; Reactome# 211859), tryptophan metabolism (6, 7, 10 Gy; BioCyc# TPHAN-DEGRADATION-1) (possibly host microbiota derived, [; ]), and proline degradation (7, 10 Gy; KEGG# ko00330).

PMC5314995	R01019	In serum, the levels of carnitine showed increases following IR exposures (10 Gy, P =<0.001
PMC5314995	R01021	Taurine decreased at 2 (P =0.012
PMC5314995	R01027	Differences in these water-soluble metabolites suggest disruption to protein digestion/absorption (primarily valine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis/degradation), biological oxidations, and fatty acid β-oxidation.

PMC5314995	R01033	Uridine significantly increased at 2 Gy, but not at 4, 6, 7, and 10 Gy.
PMC5348428	A00004	The results revealed reduced levels of fatty acids and elevated levels of several amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine, lactate, serine, cystine, lysine, glutamine/glutamate, taurine, leucine, alanine, isoleucine and valine) in thyroid tissues, as well as reduced levels of amino acids such as valine, tyrosine, proline, lysine, leucine and elevated levels of glucose, mannose, pyruvate and 3-hydroxybutyrate in plasma, are involved in the metabolic alterations in PTMC.
PMC5348428	D00000	In this metabolomics study of thyroid tissues, as compared with the healthy group, the PTMC group had lower levels of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, and higher levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, lactate, serine, cystine, lysine, glutamine/glutamate, taurine, leucine, alanine, isoleucine, and valine.
PMC5348428	D00003	Higher lactate levels in cancer tissue could be caused by activation of glycolysis.
PMC5348428	D00004	In this metabolomics study of plasma, as compared with healthy group, the PTMC group had increased glucose, mannose, and pyruvate levels, and an increase in concentration of these compounds might be associated with upregulated glycolysis and enhanced amino acid catabolism.
PMC5348428	D00005	As described above, amino acids undergo glucoeogenic and ketogenic pathways that could also contribute to blood glucose.
PMC5348428	D00006	The significant increase in 3-hydroxybutyrate, a precursor for fatty acid synthesis, in PTMC samples indicates that a higher rate of lipid synthesis might arise from altered lypolysis linked to the high-energy demands of these cells.
PMC5348428	D00008	Amino acids such as valine, tyrosine, proline, lysine, and leucine were all significantly decreased in PTMC samples, which could have been due to increased protein synthesis in cancer patients.
PMC5348428	D00009	A decreased level of valine and leucine, which are branched-chain amino acids that can be converted into acetyl coenzyme A (Acyl-CoA) derivatives, in the plasma of PTMC patients indicated high rates of catabolism.
PMC5348428	D00010	The catabolism of valine and leucine leads to reduced coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide levels and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide levels, which can be utilized for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) generation, further suggesting that the decrease may be due to the strong demand of ATP by tumor cells.
PMC5348428	D00011	A reduction in proline and lysine levels is also observed, which might be a resulted by high rates of catabolism, and leading to an upregulated production of glutamate.
PMC5348428	D00012	Moreover, the concentration of tyrosine is found to significantly decreased in the plasma of PTMC samples, as tyrosine is equally important for protein biosynthesis as well as an intermediate in the biosynthesis of the catecholamines (dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine).

PMC5348428	R01005	(Figures , ), including phenylalanine, tyrosine, serine, cystine, lysine, glutamine/glutamate, taurine, leucine, alanine, isoleucine, valine, fatty acids and lactate, compared with healthy group, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with lower concentration and the others with higher concentration (Figure ).
PMC5348428	R02007	Accordingly, nine metabolites in plasma were considered, including glucose, mannose, 3-hydroxybutyrate, valine, tyrosine, proline, lysine, leucine, and pyruvate.
PMC5348428	R02008	Compared with the healthy group, the PTMC group had higher levels of glucose, mannose, and 3-hydroxybutyrate (p < 0.01; p < 0.001).
PMC5348428	R02009	Pyruvate level were higher in PTMC samples with no significant difference (p > 0.05), however, amino acids such as valine, tyrosine, proline, lysine, and leucine were all in significantly lower quantities in the PTMC samples (p < 0.01; p < 0.001)
PMC5348428	R02018	A multivariable ROC curve was generated using the nine significant changed metabolites from plasma, which were glucose, mannose, 3-hydroxybutyrate, valine, tyrosine, proline, lysine, leucine, and pyruvate, and was built based on the PLS-DA model.
PMC5358793	A00004	By adding electrically charged silica nanoparticles to the solution NMR sample, metabolites of opposite charge bind to the nanoparticles and their NMR signals are weakened or entirely suppressed due to peak broadening caused by the slow rotational tumbling of the nanometer sized nanoparticles.
PMC5358793	D01011	Examples include lysine, arginine and histidines whose NMR peaks became suppressed after binding to the much larger nanoparticles.
PMC5358793	D01012	In addition, metabolites with a quaternary nitrogen that has a positive charge also belong to this category, such as choline, betaines, and trigonelline.
PMC5358793	D01016	The addition of charged nanoparticles to an NMR sample can be likened to the conversion of the NMR sample into an affinity column analogous to solid-phase extraction whereby the resins are micro- or nano-sized silica particles.
PMC5358793	D01017	We focused on silica nanoparticles in this work, but quantum dots or other nanoparticles, such as gold or silver based nanoparticles, are likely to work as well.
PMC5358793	D01019	As can be seen in , the NMR signals of the negatively charged metabolites of the mixture, namely citric acid, lactic acid, and shikimic acid were either entirely suppressed or strongly weakened (less than 5% peak intensity left).
PMC5358793	D02010	For example, the NMR peaks of arginine are often very close to or overlap with those of other metabolites of a complex mixture.
PMC5358793	D02011	When querying the spectrum against the database, arginine could not be identified.
PMC5358793	D02012	By contrast, when querying only the subgroup of peaks that in the presence of the SNPs were suppressed, arginine could be identified with a matching ratio of 0.8 and the uniqueness of 3/5 (one of the broad multiplets of a CH_2 group was too weak to observe).
PMC5358793	M00001	The following metabolites were obtained for the preparation of model mixtures: citric acid monohydrate (C_6 H_8 O_7 •H_2 O, 99%), N,N-dimethylglycine (C_4 H_9 O_2 N, 99%), D-glucose (C_6 H_12 O_6 , 99.5%), L-glutamic acid (C_5 H_9 NO_4, 98.5%), L-histidine (C_6 H_9 N_3 O_2 , 98.5%), sodium lactate (C_3 H_5 NaO_3 , 98%), sodium phosphate dibasic (Na_2 HPO_4 , 99.0%), sodium phosphate monobasic (NaH_2 PO_4 , 99.0%), and 3-(Trimethylsilyl)-1-propanesulfonic acid sodium salt (DSS) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
PMC5358793	M00002	L-alanine (C_3 H_7 NO_2 , 98.5%), L-arginine (C_6 H_14 N_4 O_2 , 98.5%), L-asparagine monohydrate (C_4 H_8 N_2 O_3 •H2O, 98.5%), L-glutamine (C_5 H_10 N_2 O_3 , 98.5%), L-lysine hydrochloride (C_6 H_14 N_2 O_2 •HCl, 98.5%), and L-valine (C_5 H_11 NO_2 , 98.5%) were purchased from Fisher BioReagents.
PMC5358793	M01000	Bindzil_® 2040 silica nanoparticles (anionic SNPs) were obtained from Eka Chemicals.
PMC5358793	M01003	pH 7.0 sodium phosphate buffer dissolved in D_2 O followed by centrifugation at 4300 rpm for 30 min to increase concentration.
PMC5358793	M01004	Finally, the volume of concentrated SNPs was adjusted back to 1 mL using the same phosphate buffer, with a recovery rate of 70%, quantified by gravimetric analysis after completely solvent evaporation.
PMC5358793	M01005	The particle concentration was estimated to be 50 μM. LUDOX_® CL silica nanoparticles (cationic SNPs) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
PMC5358793	M02000	A model mixture of common metabolites consisting of unlabeled alanine, arginine, citric acid, dimethylglycine, glucose, histidine, lactic acid, lysine, shikimic acid, and valine with a uniform concentration of 2 mM was prepared in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 in D_2 O for experiments involving anionic SNPs.
PMC5358793	M03002	The powder sample was dissolved in 1100 μL 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0.
PMC5358793	M03003	The nanoparticle-free sample was made of 550 μL urine sample with 50 μL phosphate buffer.
PMC5358793	R00003	For example, arginine overlaps with other metabolites including lysine, histidine, glucose, and dimethyglycine.
PMC5358793	R00004	The addition of anionic SNPs leads to the removal of all arginine peaks, which simplifies the analysis and quantitation of the other metabolites.
PMC5358793	R00006	The only positively charged metabolites arginine, lysine, and histidine rank as the top 3 compounds in terms of peak suppression.
PMC5358793	R00007	Since histidine has a side chain pK_a of 6.0 with a pI value of 7.59, at pH 7.0 it is only partially charged and hence it interacts with the SNPs not as strongly as arginine or lysine, which is consistent with the results in .
PMC5358793	R00008	The model mixture also demonstrates that other compounds, such as valine, with local charges, but zero net charge, can also be partially suppressed.
PMC5358793	R00015	(a) TEM image and (b) size distribution of near-spherical anionic silica nanoparticles (SNPs) after being vacuum dried and concentrated on a copper grid.
PMC5358793	R01008	Negatively charged acidic metabolites, such as lactic acid, citric acid, and acetic acid were not perturbed.
PMC5358793	R01011	Metabolites that have only one or two cross-peaks, such as methylguanidine or dimethylglycine can be easily misassigned due to peak overlaps.
PMC5358966	M00002	Briefly, 2 mL Bindzil 2040 silica nanoparticles (AkzoNobel and Eka Chemicals) were used to remove the majority of serum protein.
PMC5358966	M00004	The flow-through was lyophilized and dissolved in 200 μL D_2 O with 50 mM phosphate buffer and 0.5 mM 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS).
PMC5358966	M00006	The spike-in experiment was performed by spiking 1 mM isoleucine, 2 mM triglyceric acid, 2 mM trigonelline, and 2 mM 2-aminobutyric acid into a fresh serum sample followed by the collection of the same 2D NMR data sets for comparison with the original serum sample.
PMC5358966	M00008	50 0.5 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid ( )
PMC5358966	R00025	Since chemical shift reference errors can have a large adverse effect on database query, COLMARm provides a convenient semi-automatic referencing option, which is based on pattern matching of either the standard referencing compound DSS or commonly occurring metabolites alanine, leucine, glucose, and lactic acid.
PMC5358966	R00045	Metabolites with only one isomeric state appear as “Metabolite_1_1”, such as “Acetic_acid_1_1”, whereas metabolites with more than one isomeric state and/or spin system appear as “Metabolite Name_n _m ” where n =1,2,3, … are different isomers of the same metabolite (e.g., Glucose_1_1, Glucose_2_1 for α-glucose and β-glucose, respectively) and m =1,2,3, … are different spin systems of the metabolite (e.g., L-Carnitine_1_1, L-Carnitine_1_2).
PMC5358966	R01005	illustrates the protocol for serum for the identification of isoleucine.
PMC5358966	R01006	The experimental HSQC peaks of isoleucine (green circles) matched reasonably well the database chemical shifts of isoleucine (red circles).
PMC5358966	R01008	Observation of the cross-peak connectivity patterns of isoleucine in serum TOCSY as well as HSQC-TOCSY, which were consistent with the expected cross-peak patterns from the database, validated the presence of isoleucine in serum.
PMC5358966	R01011	One of the new metabolites identified in serum was glyceric acid.
PMC5358966	R01012	Glyceric acid peaks appeared in the crowded region of the HSQC.
PMC5358966	R01016	Another instructive example concerns the identification of 2-aminobutyric acid, which has three HSQC cross-peaks that all reside in an overlapped _1 H region and made validation by TOCSY alone difficult.
PMC5358966	R01018	Illustration of COLMARm with the identification of isoleucine in human serum by the co-analysis of (A) HSQC, (B) TOCSY, and (C) HSQC-TOCSY.
PMC5358966	R01019	Green and red circles represent experimental and database cross-peaks of isoleucine, respectively, whereas magenta circles represent the expected isoleucine peaks according to the TOCCATA database.
PMC5358966	R01020	The close match between green and red circles identifies isoleucine as a strong candidate.
PMC5358966	R01022	Identification of glyceric acid with the COLMARm web server by uploading (A) HSQC, (B) TOCSY and (C) HSQC-TOCSY of human serum as input.
PMC5358966	R01023	Green and red circles represent experimental and database peaks of glyceric acid, respectively, whereas magenta circles represent the expected glyceric acid peaks from the TOCCATA database.
PMC5358966	R01024	The close match between green and red circles indicates that glyceric acid is a strong candidate, which was validated by the good agreement between the magenta peaks and the TOCSY and HSQC-TOCSY peaks.
PMC5358966	R01030	One of the low abundance metabolites identified in serum was trigonelline.
PMC5358966	R01031	Trigonelline has five HSQC peaks, but only two had a sufficiently high signal-to-noise in the HSQC spectrum of serum, which made the identification of trigonelline by using HSQC alone ambiguous.
PMC5358966	R01032	On the other hand, many of the trigonelline signals were detected in the serum TOCSY spectrum, which again illustrates the beneficial complementarity of TOCSY.
PMC5358966	R01034	In this study, several of the true positive metabolites such as 1-methlyhistidine and 2-aminobutyric acid had a uniqueness value 0, which would have been missed if the uniqueness filter had been applied in the HSQC-based query.
PMC5358966	R01037	Out of the 62 serum metabolites identified in this study, 48 of them were previously identified in human serum by NMR._, However, the other 14 metabolites (1-methyluric acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid, alpha-hydroxyisobutyric acid, glyceric acid, glycerophosphocholine, ethanolamine, citrulline, hypotaurine, malate, trigonelline, taurine, valeric acid, beta-alanine, trans-4-hydroxyproline) have been identified here for the first time by using NMR alone.
PMC5358966	R01038	Taurine, citrulline and trans-4-hydroxyproline were previously identified in human blood plasma by NMR._, The Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) categorizes the confidence of metabolite identification according to four different levels, where level 1 (highest confidence level) is achieved by spiking of authentic standards into the original sample.
PMC5358966	R01039	In this study only the presence of isoleucine, 2-aminobutyrate, glyceric acid, and trigonelline were confirmed by spiking experiments (level 1 identification).
PMC5358966	R01042	For instance, glyceric acid and alpha-hydroxyisobutyric acid were previously identified in serum by GC-MS, glycerophosphocholine was previously identified by LC-MS, and taurine and citrulline were previously identified by ion-exchange chromatography.
PMC5358966	R01047	Notably, some of the newly identified serum metabolites such as trigonelline, taurine and beta-alanine were previously detected in human urine.
PMC5371670	D00003	The endocannabinoid system is a vital endogenous signaling system that comprises of the cannabinoid receptors, their endogenous ligands (the endocannabinoids), and the enzymes catalyzing anabolism and catabolism of endocannabinoid (Di Marzo et al., ).
PMC5371670	D00006	Obesity is characterized by altered gut microbiota, low grade inflammation and dysregulation of endocannabinoid system, in majority of the cases overactive of the system (Muccioli et al., ; Geurts et al., ).
PMC5371670	D00007	In this study, Anandamide 0-phosphate was found to be up-regulated at 6 and 12 months following H. pylori eradication but it was then down-regulated at 18 months post-eradication.
PMC5371670	D00008	Anandamide 0-phosphate is one of the intermediates in the biosynthesis of anandamine (KEGG: map04723).
PMC5371670	D00009	Anandamide (also known as N -arachidonoylethanolamine or AEA) is an endocannabinoid that is synthesized from N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) by numerous pathways or alternatively, it can also be synthesized from free arachidonic acid and ethanolamine by the reversal action of a fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)
PMC5371670	D00011	The marked changes in expression of Anandamide 0-phosphate could be linked with the perturbation of gut microbiota post-H. pylori eradication which in turn causes dysregulation of the endocannabinoid system and subsequently affect the regulation of energy metabolism and therefore, lead to the development of obesity.
PMC5371670	D00012	Phytosphingosine, sphinganine and ceramide that are involved in sphingolipid metabolism (KEGG: map00600) were found to be changed significantly in this study.
PMC5371670	D00013	Ceramide is a main molecule in sphingolipid metabolism and a precursor of complex sphingolipids (Sugiura et al., ; Hannun and Obeid, ).
PMC5371670	D00014	Sphingolipids are important signal molecules that mediate several biological functions for instance cell proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis (Futerman and Hannun, ; Hannun and Obeid, ; Morad and Cabot, ).
PMC5371670	D00015	Phytosphingosine detected in fecal samples was down-regulated post-H. pylori eradication and we believe that it could be related to the reduced inflammation of the stomach lining after H. pylori eradication.
PMC5371670	D00016	On the contrary, sphinganine (also known as dihydrosphingosine) detected in the fecal samples was found to be up-regulated significantly 6 and 12 months post-eradication.
PMC5371670	D00018	One of the most interesting findings of this study is Lipid A-disaccharide-1-P was significantly elevated 12 and 18 months post-H. pylori eradication.
PMC5371670	D00019	Lipid A, one of the three structural components of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes the pathophysiological effects associated with Gram-negative bacteria infections (Lodowska et al., ).
PMC5371670	D00021	The up-regulation of Lipid A 12 and 18 months post-H. pylori eradication could probably be associated with the perturbation of microbiota in the gut following H. pylori eradication.
PMC5371670	D00024	Nevertheless, we could not prove that the Lipid A was from H. pylori .
PMC5371670	D00025	A Proteobacteria hopanoid named 32,35-anhydrobacteriohopaneterol (Talbot et al., ) was found to be down-regulated at 18 months post-eradication.
PMC5371670	D00026	Hopanoids are bacterial pentacyclic triterpenoids that are analogous to eukaryotic steroids structurally and biosynthetically (Ourisson et al., ;
PMC5371670	D00028	Hopanoids may play a role in the alteration of cell membrane permeability in adaptation to extreme environmental conditions in many bacteria.
PMC5371670	D00030	In the actinomycete Frankia , the hopanoids in diazovesicle membranes probably restrict the entry of oxygen by building the lipid bilayer tighter and more compact (Berry et al., ).
PMC5371670	D00031	The Proteobacteria in the gut including H. pylori may be expressing 32,35-anhydrobacteriohopaneterol to adapt the hostile environment in the gut.
PMC5371670	D00032	The perturbation of gut microbiota following H. pylori eradication therapy may be the reason of the reduced expression of this hopanoid.
PMC5371670	D01001	The identified potential small molecules detected cover the essential metabolic pathways, hence allowing the determination of key intermediates of heme biosynthesis and bilirubin degradation, amino acid metabolisms, lipid metabolism, and energy metabolism (tricarboxylic acid cycle).
PMC5371670	D02000	Melatonin and 5-Hydroxytryptophan involved in melatonin biosynthesis were down-regulated following H. pylori eradication.
PMC5371670	D02001	Recent experimental evidence suggested that melatonin may influence food intake, energy expenditure, the accumulation of energy in adipose tissue, insulin secretion and glycemic control (Peschke et al., ; Picinato et al., ; Prokopenko et al., ; Amaral et al., ).
PMC5371670	D02002	It has been proposed that the reduction in melatonin production may induce insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, sleep disturbance, and metabolic circadian disorganization characterizing a state of chrono-disruption leading to metabolic disorders such as obesity (Pulimeno et al., ;
PMC5371670	D02004	Taken together, the down-regulation of 5-Hydroxytryptophan and melatonin in plasma post-H. pylori eradication may be associated with the protective effect of H. pylori against metabolic disorders.
PMC5371670	D02005	6-phosphogluconic acid, in the pentose phosphate pathway, was elevated at 6 months post-eradication.
PMC5371670	D02006	This finding is in agreement with that of a previous study on hepatic gene expression whereby it was reported that the pentose phosphate pathway was up-regulated in obese patients with type 2 diabetes (Takamura et al., ).
PMC5371670	D02007	An in vivo study also demonstrated significance increase of G6PD expression and activity, NADPH levels, and 6-phosphogluconic acid generation in the liver of adult male Zucker fa/fa rats, a prototype model of hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes (Gupte et al., ).
PMC5371670	D02008	Therefore, the elevation of 6-phosphogluconic acid at 6 months post-eradication could be a metabolic signature of metabolic disorders.
PMC5371670	D02010	N-Methyl-4-pyridone-3-carboxamide is one of the end products of nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (NAD) degradation.
PMC5371670	D02012	NAD is one of the cofactors essential for redox reactions.
PMC5371670	D02013	NAD and NADP play pivotal roles in metabolic conversions as signal transducers and in cellular defense systems in which they participate as electron carriers in energy transduction and biosynthetic processes (Pollak et al., ).
PMC5371670	D02014	This observation indicated that H. pylori eradication may affect the biosynthesis of NAD in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and hence, it corroborated with our previous finding that H. pylori eradication may affect the regulation of energy metabolism in the human body (Yap et al., ).
PMC5371670	D02015	Citric acid and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), an intermediate and a cofactor of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), were changed post-H. pylori eradication.
PMC5371670	D02020	N1,N12-diacetylspermine is an acetylated product of spermidine and spermine controlled by spermidine-spermineN1-acetyltransferase (SSAT) using acetyl-CoA as substrate.
PMC5371670	D02021	Polyamines (putrescine, spermine and spermidine) are organic polycations that are important for various cellular functions such as cell growth, cancer and aging of which its metabolism is tightly controlled (Pegg and Casero, ).
PMC5371670	D02024	The up-regulation of N1,N12-diacetylspermine at 6 and 12 months post-eradication but with no significant changes at 18 months-post eradication may indicate the dysregulation of polyamine metabolism which could be a potential predictive signature of metabolic disorders such as obesity.
PMC5371670	D02025	Studies also showed that the increase in blood concentrations of selected essential amino acids and their derivatives, in particular, branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), aromatic amino acids (Adams, ), and the decreases in the metabolism of essential fatty acids (linoleic and α-linoleic acids) and polyunsaturated fatty acids [such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)]
PMC5371670	D02027	Correspondingly, in this study, we found that a cofactor involved in the metabolism of BCAA, isovaleryl-CoA, as well as numerous small molecules involved in aromatic amino acid metabolisms (tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine metabolisms) were perturbed following H. pylori eradication and these small molecules were all down-regulated at 18 months-post eradication.
PMC5371670	D02029	The intermediates involved in the essential fatty acid metabolisms (linoleic and α-linoleic acids metabolism) and the polyunsaturated fatty acid EPA were down-regulated at 18 months post-H. pylori eradication as well.
PMC5371670	D02031	Following H. pylori eradication was the down-regulation of tetrapyrroles and derivatives that are involved in heme biosynthesis and bilirubin degradation.
PMC5371670	D02032	Coproporphyrinogen III, protoporphyrin IX, hematoporphyrin, and harderoporphyrin are naturally occurring porphyrins, intermediates that play an important role in heme biosynthesis.
PMC5371670	D02033	Heme is critical also for the biological functions of several enzymes, such as cytochromes (Ajioka et al., ).
PMC5371670	D02035	The synthesis of bile acids (BAs) is the key pathway of cholesterol catabolism in human.
PMC5371670	D02037	BAs can influence glucose and lipid metabolism through the activation of farnesoid X receptor (FXR), lowers plasma triglyceride (TG) synthesis and/or the modulation of glucose-induced lipogenic genes (Lefebvre et al., ).
PMC5371670	D02039	Up-regulation of prequalene diphosphate, an intermediate involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, was probably linked to the increase of bile acid in the post-H. pylori eradication plasma.
PMC5371670	D02040	We also identified two BAs, taurocholic acid and taurochenodeoxycholic acid in which they were up-regulated at 6 and 12 months post-H. pylori eradication but down-regulated at 18 months-post eradication.
PMC5371670	D02041	Consistently, majority of the TG in our study were found to be down-regulated at 6 and 12 months post-H. pylori eradication (File ).
PMC5371670	D02043	However, at 18 months post-eradication, the bile acids in plasma were down-regulated instead, and strange enough, majority of the plasma TG were still down-regulated as compared to Baseline.
PMC5371670	D03000	The down-regulation of Biliverdin IX, which acts as the precursor of biosynthesis of bilirubin, as well as uribilinoids (Mesobilirubinogen and L-Urobilinogen) and urobilins (I-Urobilin and L-Urobilin), which are by-products of bilirubin degradation could be associated with the down-regulation of cellular antioxidant activity.
PMC5371670	D03001	Bilirubin is a lipophilic linear tetrapyrrole found abundantly in blood plasma of mammals.
PMC5371670	D03002	It is the final product of heme catabolism.
PMC5371670	D03003	The first major step of heme catabolic pathway involves the formation of water-soluble biliverdin from heme by heme oxygenase (HO) which is subsequently reduced by biliverdin reductase (BVR) to bilirubin (Baranano et al., ).
PMC5371670	D03004	Studies have shown that bilirubin is a main physiologic antioxidant cytoprotectant (Stocker et al., ; Baranano et al., ; Kapitulnik, ; Sedlak et al., ) which can protect cells from a 10,000-fold excess of H_2 O_2 (Baranano et al., ; Sedlak et al., ).
PMC5371670	D03005	The down-regulation of biliverdin IX in plasma post-H. pylori eradication may indicate low concentration of bilirubin in tissues that leads to marked increase of reactive oxygen species in the tissue levels and causes apoptotic cell death (Baranano et al.,
PMC5371670	D03009	On the other hand, accumulating evidence suggests that bilirubin also possesses immunomodulatory properties (Nejedlá, ; Větvička et al., ;
PMC5371670	D03011	Therefore, the down-regulation of Biliverdin IX and by-products of bilirubin following H. pylori eradication could be related to the negative association of H. pylori with asthma and allergy (Amedei et al., , ;
PMC5371670	D04000	Ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) are the main bioactive sphingolipids that act as signaling molecules to regulate physiological events such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammation (Futerman and Hannun, ; Hannun and Obeid, ; Morad and Cabot, ).
PMC5371670	D04001	Ceramide is an important molecule in sphingolipid metabolism (KEGG: map00600) and a precursor of complex sphingolipids.
PMC5371670	D04002	S1P has strong proinflammatory properties.
PMC5371670	D04004	S1P also stimulates cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2), thus leading to production of inflammatory mediators (Takeuchi et al., ).
PMC5371670	D04007	In our study, following H. pylori eradication, the down-regulation of S1P, sphinganine 1-phosphate and phytosphingosine could probably be related to the reduction of sub-clinical inflammation in the stomach lining.
PMC5371670	D04008	These observations probably complimented with the down-regulation of fecal pytosphingosine post- H. pylori eradication.
PMC5371670	D04009	It is important to note that we also observed significant changes of ceramides and other more complex sphingolipids, such as glucosylceramides, and lactosylceramide in the plasma but they did not display a consistent pattern of expression (File ).
PMC5371670	D04011	Thus, changes of expression of sphingolipids in this study may reflect another aspect of the influence of gut microflora on biochemical reactions in blood.
PMC5371670	D05000	On filtering out exogenous plasma metabolites that were not produced by the human body, two hopanoids produced by Proteobacteria in the plasma, bacteriohopane-,32,33,34-triol-35-cyclitolguanine and 2-methyl-32,35-anhydrobacteriohopanetetrol, were detected that may be correlated with the Proteobacteria hopanoid (32,35-anhydrobacteriohopaneterol) found in fecal lipidome.
PMC5371670	D05001	Similar to the hopanoid found in fecal lipidome, these two plasma hopanoids were also down-regulated post-H. pylori eradication (File ).

PMC5371670	R03008	These significantly changed metabolites included amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, cofactors, polar lipids etc.
PMC5371670	R03010	From the Pathway Analysis, porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism was found to be the major perturbed pathway followed by tryptophan metabolism and bile acid biosynthesis.
PMC5371670	R03012	When plasma metabolome from Baseline was compared with post-H. pylori eradication groups, a number of fatty acids and sphingolipids involved in biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and sphingolipid metabolism respectively were down- regulated post-H. pylori eradication.

PMC5372206	A00008	In patients with adenocarcinoma, glutamate levels were consistently higher, while glutamine and alanine levels were consistently lower.
PMC5372206	D00039	Specifically, in both studies, malignancy was associated with elevated glutamate, phenylalanine, and mannose; creatine, glutamine, threonine, and lysine were higher in the benign condition.
PMC5372206	D00043	The results clearly indicate a tipping of the balance of amino acid metabolism towards higher glutamate levels in malignant samples and higher glutamine and alanine levels in benign disease.
PMC5372206	D00044	These observations are consistent with earlier findings published by our group, which found elevated levels of glutamate in the serum of pancreatic cancer patients when compared to that of patients with benign pancreatic or biliary disease.
PMC5372206	D00045	It is also consistent with findings in many cancer model systems that show a switch to glutamine consumption, and increased glutamate and succinate production, in patients with rapidly proliferating cancer cells, as part of the “Warburg effect” [,].
PMC5372206	D00046	Arginine and ornithine are part of the urea cycle and feed the production of putrescine, the rate-limiting step in protein synthesis.
PMC5372206	D00047	The conversion of arginine to ornithine, by the enzyme arginase, has been suggested as a major regulator of cell growth.
PMC5372206	D00048	It is therefore interesting that arginine and ornithine levels were lower in the serum of patients with pancreatic cancer compared to benign pancreatic lesions.
PMC5372206	D00049	The level of urea, a side product of arginine-to-ornithine conversion, was slightly higher in patients with pancreatic cancer.
PMC5372206	D00053	The correlation of serum galactose with pancreatic cancer is seen in the GC-MS dataset only, as NMR did not detect galactose in these conditions.

PMC5372206	R02021	Eight metabolites were found to consistently contribute to the malignant/benign profile across all three datasets: higher levels of glutamate, myo-inositol, phenylalanine, and urea were consistently correlated with malignancy; while higher levels of glutamine, ornithine, proline, and threonine were consistently correlated with benign disease.
PMC5372206	R03001	The arginine/proline pathway had the largest impact factor (0.456, p = 0.000085) with consistently higher levels of arginine, creatine, glutamine, ornithine, and proline seen in the benign samples and consistently higher levels of glutamate and urea in malignant samples.
PMC5372206	R03002	The alanine/aspartate/glutamate pathway had the next largest impact factor (0.441, p = 0.00026), reflecting the consistently higher levels of alanine and glutamine in benign samples versus glutamate and succinate in malignant samples.
PMC5372206	R03003	Galactose levels were higher in malignant samples and the galactose metabolism pathway had the third largest impact factor (0.224, p = 0.000086).
PMC5372212	A00000	The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate sarcosine, uracil, and kynurenic acid in urine as potential biomarkers in prostate cancer detection and progression monitoring.
PMC5372212	A00001	Sarcosine, uracil, and kynurenic acid were measured in urine samples of 32 prostate cancer patients prior to radical prostatectomy, 101 patients with increased prostate-specific antigen prior to ultrasonographically-guided prostatic biopsy collected before and after prostatic massage, and 15 healthy volunteers (controls).
PMC5372212	A00005	Decreased median sarcosine and kynurenic acid and increased uracil concentrations were observed for patients with prostate cancer compared to participants without malignancy.
PMC5372212	A00007	Evaluation of biomarkers by ROC (Receiving Operating Characteristics) curve analysis showed that differentiation of prostate cancer patients from participants without malignancy was not enhanced by sarcosine or uracil levels in urine.
PMC5372212	A00008	In contrast to total PSA values, kynurenic acid was found a promising biomarker for the detection of prostate cancer particularly in cases where collection of urine samples was performed after prostatic massage.
PMC5372212	A00009	Sarcosine and uracil in urine samples of patients with prostate cancer were not found as significant biomarkers for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.

PMC5372212	D00002	The present pilot study is an attempt to investigate whether sarcosine in urine is a suitable alternative biomarker for PCa detection and progression monitoring [,].
PMC5372212	D00003	Uracil and kynurenic acid were found as promising biomarkers in urine samples of prostate cancer patients, when urine is collected before and after prostatic massage.
PMC5372212	D00006	Sarcosine is a naturally occurring derivative of glycine, formed by the enzymes glycine N -methyl transferase (GNMT) or dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH), and converted back into glycine via sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH).
PMC5372212	D00007	Sarcosine is not specific to prostatic tissue, and it plays a significant role in methyl balance as an intermediate compound in the metabolism of choline and methionine [,].
PMC5372212	D00008	In 2009, a study reported the potential role of sarcosine as a biomarker for PCa detection and prognosis.
PMC5372212	D00009	In a group of 110 patients, sarcosine was found significantly higher in urine sediments and supernatants in men with PCa compared to men with negative biopsies.
PMC5372212	D00011	Sarcosine, uracil, kynurenine, and other metabolites were reported as being significantly elevated upon disease progression, from benign to PCa to metastatic disease.
PMC5372212	D00013	Because sarcosine levels were also found to be associated with cell invasiveness, Sreekumar et al. studied the association of sarcosine with EZH2 and found that overexpression of EZH2 in benign cells increased sarcosine levels, while knockdown of EZH2 in cancerous cells decreased the amount of the metabolite.
PMC5372212	D00014	Sarcosine was reported to be directly related to the process of cancer invasion and the enzymes that regulate sarcosine levels could be potential targets for modulation of prostate cancer invasion.
PMC5372212	D00016	to declare that sarcosine is not only a novel and predictive biomarker but a key element of a potentially promising target pathway for the treatment and control of prostate cancer development.
PMC5372212	D00017	In contrast, another study—performed in 139 men with more comparable PSA biopsy values between PCa and non-PCa patients—found significantly lower sarcosine values in PCa patients compared to non-PCa patients and no significant difference between healthy men and PCa patients.
PMC5372212	D00018	Also, % fPSA had a significantly larger AUC than sarcosine (0.81 vs. 0.63; p = 0.012), and PSA was equal to sarcosine (0.64 vs. 0.63; p = 0.93).
PMC5372212	D00019	In this study, sarcosine was measured by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and sarcosine values were normalized to urine creatinine.
PMC5372212	D00020	Another group measured sarcosine levels in the supernatant of post-DRE urine of 17 PCa patients and compared them with the values in biopsy-negative patients.
PMC5372212	D00021	They did not find any statistically significant difference between the two groups, although they observed increased sarcosine levels in samples from healthy participants.
PMC5372212	D00022	A correlation between sarcosine levels and total PSA or PCa antigen 3 was not shown.
PMC5372212	D00023	Using the isotope dilution GC/MS approach with microwave-assisted derivatization, Wu et al. did not find any statistical difference in urinary sarcosine levels between PCa patients and the control group.
PMC5372212	D00024	Yet another group evaluated sarcosine levels in urine supernatants and sediments and used PCa antigen 3 (PCA3) and % fPSA as comparators.
PMC5372212	D00025	Regardless of the specimen type, sarcosine was significantly higher in PCa patients than in controls, but there was no correlation with the Gleason score or clinical stage.
PMC5372212	D00026	Kynurenic acid is an NMDA antagonist produced from kynurenine, a derivative of tryptophan.
PMC5372212	D00027	Tryptophan is catalyzed by two distinct enzymes, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO).
PMC5372212	D00028	Both TDO and IDO lead to oxidative cleavage of tryptophan pyrrole ring resulting in formation of kynurenine, which is subsequently converted to kynurenic acid by kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT).
PMC5372212	D00029	The ratio of kynurenine/tryptophan in serum was investigated as a potential marker for detecting prostate cancer.
PMC5372212	D00030	Data on the potential use of uracil as a biomarker for prostate cancer detection and progression monitoring are limited [,].
PMC5372212	D00031	In the present study, the median sarcosine and kynurenic acid values were found to be lower in PCa patients than in participants without malignancy, in accordance to previously published results [,].
PMC5372212	D00032	The opposite (higher values in PCa patients) was observed for uracil.
PMC5372212	D00033	Sarcosine, uracil, and kynurenic acid values were not associated with age or tumor grade (Gleason score <7 vs. ≥7).
PMC5372212	D00034	ROC curve analyses showed that the differentiation of PCa patients and participants without malignancy was not enhanced by sarcosine or uracil measurements in comparison with total PSA, but kynurenic acid was found to improve detection of prostate cancer when measured in urine samples collected after prostatic massage.
PMC5372212	D00037	However, the need to collect urine after prostatic massage, in order to use kynurenic acid for diagnostic purposes as an alternative or additional biomarker, might discourage at least some patients from attending population-based screening for prostate cancer due to anticipated pain or discomfort.
PMC5372212	D00042	In summary, the data presented here show that urinary sarcosine and uracil are not found as suitable biomarkers for the detection of prostate cancer, in contrast to kynurenic acid, when it is measured in urine collected after prostatic massage.
PMC5372212	D00045	Variations in the results of investigations on the potential of sarcosine and related metabolites as PCa biomarkers have been attributed to variations and the lack of harmonization in study design, inclusion/exclusion criteria for subject recruitment, as well as in the sampling process.
PMC5372212	M00000	LC/MS grade Acetonitrile (ACN) was abtained from Carlo Erba (Van de Remil, Paris, France).
PMC5372212	M00002	Ammonium formate (NH_4 HCO_2 ) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (Gillingham, UK).
PMC5372212	M01010	For LC-MS/MS analysis a volume of 100 μL of sample was diluted with 100 μL of MeOH.
PMC5372212	M01014	Supernatants were diluted with MeOH (1:2 v/v ) vortexed and centrifuged at 7000 rpm for 10 min.
PMC5372212	M02003	Sarcosine, uracil, and kynurenic acid were detected using Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM) mode in a single injection of 15.5 min.
PMC5372212	M02004	The MRM transitions for the three metabolites were set as follows: sarcosine m /z 90–44, CV = 20 V, CE = 8 V; uracil m /z 113–70, CV = 40 V, CE = 15 V; and kynurenic acid m /z
PMC5372212	M02007	For chromatographic separation the mobile phase was a mixture of (A) ACN:
PMC5372212	M02008	H_2 O, 95:5 v/v and (B) H_2 O:ACN, 70:30 v/v both with final ammonium formate buffer concentration of 10 Mm and elution was performed with a gradient program started with 100% A, then rising to 15% B linearly over the next 2 min, finally reaching 40% B over 2 min and returning to initial conditions over 5 min.
PMC5372212	M02012	The correlation coefficient R_2 resulted from calibration curve was 0.998 for sarcosine, 0.996 for uracil, and 0.996 for kynurenic acid, indicating good linearity of the method over a wide range of concentrations (1 μg/L–1 mg/L).
PMC5372212	M02015	Replicate injections of urine samples spiked at different concentrations were performed and accuracy ranged for sarcosine from 90% to 95%, for uracil from 89% to 96%, and for kynurenic acid from 90% to 98% while relative standard deviation (RSD, %) was found to range from 4.2% to 11% for sarcosine, from 2.7% to 10% for uracil, and from 4.2% to 10.5% for kynurenic acid.
PMC5372212	M02016	Recovery (%) was assessed after spiking urine samples with a standard before and after extraction and it was found to be 112% for sarcosine, 121.4% for uracil, and 113.7%. for kynurenic acid.
PMC5372212	M02019	Urinary concentrations of metabolites were not normalized to urinary creatinine since that could result in an underestimation or overestimation of the biomarker excretion rate depending on the clinical context.
PMC5372212	M02022	Some studies suggest that normalization to urinary creatinine may be inappropriate at times, as urinary creatinine excretion rate may vary greatly, depending on the situation.
PMC5372212	R01000	Initially, UGPB group was studied in order to investigate any correlation between the levels of sarcosine, kynurenic acid, and uracil in urine samples with the histopathologic results such as positive or negative in cancer, atypia, and inflammation.
PMC5372212	R01004	Although there were no statistical significant observations, in general sarcosine presented at higher concentration levels in case of inflammation for both pre- and post-PM categories and uracil levels were found increased in participants with normal results after UGPB only in samples that collected after PM.
PMC5372212	R01005	With regard to kynurenic acid, the average concentration in samples collected prior to PM was higher than the average concentration found in healthy subjects after UGPB; the case of post-PM urine was increased in patients with atypia.

PMC5372212	R01014	However, sarcosine was still found at slightly higher levels in urine samples of patients with inflammation of the prostatic tissue, uracil decreased in urine samples of patients with atypia and overall, patients with normal histopathologic results had the highest concentrations of kynurenic acid.
PMC5372212	R01016	acid: kynurenic acid.
PMC5372212	R01024	Participants with PCa undergoing RP presented highest sarcosine and uracil concentrations compare to those undergoing UGPB and controls (p = 0.01, ).
PMC5372212	R01025	In the case of kynurenic acid, statistically significant higher concentration levels were observed in the control group compared to group A (p = 0.019) and B (p = 0.004).
PMC5372212	R01030	Initially, analysis was performed for all participants and it was observed that both sarcosine (AUC: 0.47, p = 0.554) and kynurenic acid (AUC: 0.44, p = 0.251), had no diagnostic value.
PMC5372212	R01031	Uracil (AUC: 0.59, p = 0.066) showed the highest diagnostic value although not statistically significant (a, Table S1 in Supplementary Materials).
PMC5372212	R01032	In patients undergoing UGPB none of the studied metabolites detected in pre-PM samples showed diagnostic potential (sarcosine: AUC: 0.38, p = 0.044, kynurenic acid: AUC: 0.41, p = 0.128, uracil AUC: 0.47, p = 0.594).
PMC5372212	R01033	Kynurenic acid in post-PM urine samples presented the highest significant diagnostic value (AUC: 0.62, p = 0.041) compared to sarcosine and uracil (sarcosine: AUC: 0.46, p = 0.473, uracil: AUC: 0.54, p = 0.492)
PMC5372212	R01036	In a,b (Pearson correlation heatmap) it can be observed that sarcosine correlates positively with biopsy results in both pre- and post-PM cases.
PMC5372212	R01038	For both pre- and post-PM cases, uracil and sarcosine correlate positively, while kynurenic acid correlates negatively with biopsy results.
PMC5372212	R01041	Again, results from urine samples of all participants did not show any predictive value, for sarcosine (AUC: 0.48, p = 0.819), kynurenic acid (AUC: 0.51, p = 0.858), and uracil (AUC: 0.54, p = 0.525)
PMC5372212	R01043	Low diagnostic value was observed for uracil in pre-PM urine samples of patients undergoing UGPB (uracil: AUC: 0.54, p = 0.595, sarcosine: AUC: 0.51, p = 0.927, kynurenic acid: AUC: 0.5, p = 0.985), while kynurenic acid showed a slightly increased diagnostic value in post-PM urine samples (kynurenic acid: AUC: 0.57, p = 0.36, sarcosine: AUC: 0.52, p = 0.84, uracil: AUC: 0.52, p = 0.777)

PMC5372212	R01048	Additionally, Pearson correlation was performed in order to assess any correlation between the detected metabolites in patients with prostate cancer from group B and Gleason score, and only kynurenic acid was found to slightly correlate negatively (−0.2) with Gleason score.

PMC5387673	M11001	Differences in metabolite concentrations in USA and Japanese populations from INTERMAP study were investigated by linear regression analysis using the default linear regression modeling tools (lm) in R.

PMC5387673	R09005	Metabolite concentrations obtained from the targeted analyses of 2075 urine samples from USA (first visit; 1036 male and 1039 female) and 1119 samples from Japan (first visit; 560 male and 559 female) were normalized by creatinine measured by DI-nESI-HRMS in each sample, and log-transformed prior to the calculation of a linear regression model with concentration (as μmol/mmol creatinine) as the dependent variable and population (USA, Japan), gender, age, and BMI as the explanatory variables, which are also covariates of each other.
PMC5387673	R09007	Metabolites that differed the most between the two population were ascorbic acid, citric acid, hippuric acid, vanillylmandelic acid, and p -cresol sulfate (higher in the USA population) and daidzein and (iso)valerylglycine (higher in the Japanese population).
PMC5387673	R09009	Here, we show higher levels of excretion of daidzein, a metabolite related to soy consumption, in the Japanese population.
PMC5387673	R09010	Ascorbic acid is a component of several medications, for example, mixtures with paracetamol used to treat fever and pain, the metabolites of which detected by DI-nESI-HRMS were higher in urine samples from the USA population.
PMC5387673	R09012	We also find that gut–microbial mammalian cometabolites, hippuric acid, p -cresol sulfate, vanillylmandelic acid, phenylacetylglutamine, and indoxyl sulfate were discriminant and higher in the USA population.
PMC5387673	R09016	Citric acid, creatine, and 2-oxoglutaric acid were the most discriminant metabolites and were excreted in higher concentration in females.
PMC5387673	R09021	In this study we found that citric acid, hippuric acid, ketoleucine, phenylacetylglutamine, p -cresol sulfate, and proline betaine were inversely correlated with BMI, and N -acetylneuraminic acid, creatinine, and acetylcarnitine were directly correlated with BMI, which underpins previous findings.
PMC5387673	R09024	Randomly selected 449 high-resolution metabolic profiles (225 male and 224 female) from the USA population and 451 high-resolution metabolic profiles (240 male and 211 female) from the Japanese population obtained in positive and negative ionization modes were preprocessed as described above and, after exclusion of the samples with high concentration of glucose (m /z 203.05
PMC5387673	R09029	In negative ion mode, these were mostly attributed to drug metabolites (such as acetaminophen and its glucuronide and sulfate and aspirin metabolites) excreted at higher concentration in USA population along with hippuric acid, citric acid, and p -cresol sulfate.
PMC5387673	R09030	Uric acid (m /z 167.02) and its fragment ion (m /z 124.01) were among the metabolites excreted in higher concentration in Japanese population.
PMC5387673	R09031	The excretion of uric acid can be related to the consumption of seafood.
PMC5387673	R09032	In positive ion mode, the putatively identified metabolites found at higher levels in USA urine samples, were isomers of 1- and 3-methylhistidine (m /z 170.10), creatinine, and proline betaine (H_+ and Na_+ adducts).
PMC5387673	R09033	Both 3-methylhistidine and creatinine are related to muscle turnover, whereas 1-methylhistidine is related to meat consumption and proline betaine is a biomarker of citrus fruit consumption.
PMC5387673	R09035	An example of a spectra-like STOCSY plot illustrated in shows the correlation of the signal at m /z 170.10 detected in positive ion mode with the signals at m /z 141.07, m /z 126.10, and m /z 96.07 that are in-source fragments of 1- and 3-methylhistidine.
PMC5387673	R09037	The same approach was used to assign uric acid and its fragment in negative ion mode.
PMC5387673	R09039	The STOCSY analysis revealed the correlation of this ion with a small signal at 105.96, which allowed the assignment of saccharin and its fragment ion.
PMC5396526	A00001	Adrenal aldosterone excess is the most common cause of secondary hypertension and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity.
PMC5396526	A00002	However, adverse metabolic risk in primary aldosteronism extends beyond hypertension, with increased rates of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporosis, which cannot be easily explained by aldosterone excess.
PMC5396526	A00004	We performed mass spectrometry–based analysis of a 24-hour urine steroid metabolome in 174 newly diagnosed patients with primary aldosteronism (103 unilateral adenomas, 71 bilateral adrenal hyperplasias) in comparison to 162 healthy controls, 56 patients with endocrine inactive adrenal adenoma, 104 patients with mild subclinical, and 47 with clinically overt adrenal cortisol excess.
PMC5396526	A00007	Primary aldosteronism patients had significantly increased cortisol and total glucocorticoid metabolite excretion (all P < 0.001), only exceeded by glucocorticoid output in patients with clinically overt adrenal Cushing syndrome.
PMC5396526	A00008	Several surrogate parameters of metabolic risk correlated significantly with glucocorticoid but not mineralocorticoid output.
PMC5396526	A00009	Intratumoral CYP11B1 expression was significantly associated with the corresponding in vivo glucocorticoid excretion.
PMC5396526	A00010	Unilateral adrenalectomy resolved both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid excess.
PMC5396526	A00013	Our data indicate that glucocorticoid cosecretion is frequently found in primary aldosteronism and contributes to associated metabolic risk.
PMC5396526	D00000	A number of previous case reports or small case series (–) have reported excess glucocorticoid secretion in primary aldosteronism patients, a phenomenon thought to represent a rarity.
PMC5396526	D00001	However, the current study provides evidence for the concomitant presence of glucocorticoid excess in a large proportion of patients with primary aldosteronism, an observation we found to be independent of primary aldosteronism subtype or tumor tissue genotypes.
PMC5396526	D00002	Of note, we found that glucocorticoid output in primary aldosteronism was at least similar to that in subclinical Cushing’s syndrome, a cohort widely reported to suffer from increased cardiovascular risk (–).
PMC5396526	D00003	Intriguingly, we found that glucocorticoid excess significantly correlated with several parameters indicative of adverse metabolic risk in primary aldosteronism, including waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein, and diastolic blood pressure, in addition to body mass index and insulin resistance that were influenced by obesity in both controls and primary aldosteronism patients.
PMC5396526	D00005	This suggests that the previously unrecognized glucocorticoid excess in primary aldosteronism is a major determinant of metabolic risk.
PMC5396526	D00010	In autonomous adrenal cortisol excess, i.e., adrenal Cushing’s syndrome, adrenal androgens are usually downregulated due to reduced hypothalamic-pituitary feedback to the adrenal glands in response to the glucocorticoid excess.
PMC5396526	D00011	However, steroid metabolome analysis in our large primary aldosteronism cohort revealed not only glucocorticoid excess, but normal or increased androgen output.
PMC5396526	D00012	Intriguingly, steroid pathway analysis revealed evidence for additional autonomous production of 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, which is a major product of adrenal steroidogenesis and a direct precursor to potent androgens (, ).
PMC5396526	D00013	Steroid pathway analysis results were strongly corroborated by the results of quantitative immunohistochemistry in aldosterone-producing adenoma tissue, demonstrating a significant association of intratumoral expression of the CYP11B1 enzyme, required for the synthesis of both glucocorticoids and 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, with in vivo excretion of the corresponding steroid metabolites.
PMC5396526	D00014	Intriguingly, cosecretion of glucocorticoids could also potentially explain the recent finding that adrenal vein sampling performs less well than previously assumed in differentiating unilateral from bilateral adrenal causes of primary aldosteronism, as this test relies on the assumption of an increase in the aldosterone over cortisol ratio in unilateral disease, which may be diluted in adenomas with cosecretion.
PMC5396526	D00015	Glucocorticoid excess in mild, subclinical adrenal Cushing’s syndrome is associated with overnight dexamethasone test results that are regularly abnormal, while 24-hour urine glucocorticoid excretion is often normal.
PMC5396526	D00016	By contrast, we found that glucocorticoid excess in primary aldosteronism regularly presented with increased 24-hour urine glucocorticoid output preoperatively and one-third of patients showed evidence of compromised cortisol reserve postoperatively.
PMC5396526	D00017	However, only a few patients failed the overnight dexamethasone test and at present the reason for this is unclear.
PMC5396526	D00018	Patients with primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease, another adrenal cause of glucocorticoid excess, do not suppress after dexamethasone either, but have been shown to paradoxically increase glucocorticoid production in response to dexamethasone.
PMC5396526	D00022	However, during this period patients are exposed to the potentially fatal risk of adrenal crisis as they are not able to appropriately increase their cortisol production in case of major illness or surgery.
PMC5396526	D00023	A recent study was the first to assess the impact of unilateral adrenalectomy itself on cortisol reserve, documenting normal responses to cosyntropin testing in 30 live kidney donors tested on postoperative days 1 and 28.
PMC5396526	D00024	One would have anticipated these results, given that the physiological response to adrenalectomy will be a counter-regulatory upregulation of ACTH, stimulating cortisol production in the remaining adrenal gland.
PMC5396526	D00025	Therefore, those recent findings further corroborate that the high rate of failed responses to cosyntropin in our primary aldosteronism patients cannot be explained by mere loss of adrenal tissue volume, but will be a consequence of preoperative cortisol excess, resulting in reduced responsiveness of the contralateral adrenal and hence reduced cosyntropin-stimulated cortisol output.
PMC5396526	D01000	Our findings demonstrate that glucocorticoid excess is a highly prevalent feature in primary aldosteronism and closely linked to adverse metabolic risk; we also show evidence of autonomous adrenal androgen production in primary aldosteronism.
PMC5396526	M00004	Primary aldosteronism patients were compared to 5 comparator cohorts: healthy controls (n = 162); patients with endocrine-inactive adrenal adenoma (n = 56); patients with adrenal adenomas associated with mild, subclinical Cushing’s syndrome (n = 104); and patients with overt clinical Cushing’s syndrome (n = 47) due to a cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma.
PMC5396526	M00007	Patients were classified as suffering from overt Cushing’s syndrome if they had at least 3 abnormal biochemical test results indicative of Cushing’s, in addition to insufficiently suppressed serum cortisol levels (>5 μg/dl
PMC5396526	M00008	[>138 nmol/l]) after overnight administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone.
PMC5396526	M00009	Biochemical tests considered indicative of Cushing’s were increased urinary excretion of free cortisol, increased late-night salivary cortisol levels, and suppressed plasma corticotropin levels (<10 pg/ml
PMC5396526	M00012	Patients without typical catabolic signs, nonsuppressible serum cortisol levels, and up to 2 other abnormal biochemical tests were diagnosed as subclinical Cushing’s.
PMC5396526	M00013	For the purposes of our analysis, we divided the subclinical Cushing’s patients into 2 groups, in line with recently published consensus diagnostic criteria: possible autonomous cortisol excess, SC1, and autonomous cortisol excess, SC2, defined by serum cortisol after overnight administration of 1 mg of dexamethasone (SC1: > 1.8 and ≤ 5.0 μg/dl
PMC5396526	M00019	In addition to 24-hour urine steroid profiling, they underwent preoperative assessment for glucocorticoid excess including dexamethasone (1 mg) overnight suppression test, late-night salivary cortisol, and morning plasma ACTH; all patients underwent a postoperative cosyntropin test (serum cortisol at baseline and 30 minutes after intravenous injection of 250 μg ACTH_1–24 , Synacthen) 10–14 days after unilateral adrenalectomy.
PMC5396526	M02002	Blood samples were drawn for fasting plasma glucose and insulin, hemoglobin A_1c
PMC5396526	M02003	(HbA_1c ), total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides.
PMC5396526	M02004	Most participants (n = 107) also underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test with blood sampling at 30-minute intervals for 2 hours.
PMC5396526	M02005	Subjects were categorized as having normal glucose tolerance on the basis of 2-hour glucose values (normal glucose tolerance < 140 mg/dl
PMC5396526	M02006	[<7.8 mmol/l], impaired glucose tolerance ≥ 140 mg/dl
PMC5396526	M02008	HOMA-IR was calculated using the following formula: [fasting glucose (mmol/l) × fasting insulin (mIU/l)]/22.5.
PMC5396526	M03003	Our method allows for identification and quantification of 32 different steroid metabolites derived from mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, androgens, and their precursors; details are summarized in .
PMC5396526	M03004	3α,5β-Tetrahydroaldosterone (THAldo) represents the major mineralocorticoid metabolite.
PMC5396526	M03005	Total glucocorticoid production was assessed as the sum of quantified metabolites of cortisol and cortisone, comprising tetrahydrocortisol (THF), 5α-tetrahydrocortisol (5α-THF), tetrahydrocortisone, α- and β-cortol, α- and β-cortolone, 6β-hydroxycortisol, and urinary cortisol and cortisone.
PMC5396526	M04000	We used validated and established liquid chromatography-tandem MS assays to measure serum cortisol, serum dexamethasone, and salivary cortisol.
PMC5396526	M04003	Serum dexamethasone concentrations greater than 2.2 μg/dl (>5.6 nmol/l) were considered indicative of a valid overnight dexamethasone suppression test.
PMC5396526	M04004	Salivary cortisol assay reference ranges were 0.2–1.7
PMC5396526	M06004	For the primary aldosteronism patients and the control subjects, separately, the association between patient characteristics and both tetrahydroaldosterone and total glucocorticoid metabolites adjusted for age, sex, and body mass index differences was assessed by fitting linear regression models.
PMC5396526	M06008	For the 57 patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma immunohistochemistry data, analyses were performed to assess the association between total glucocorticoid metabolites, 11β-hydoxyandrosterone and tetrahydroaldosterone, and the level from image analysis.
PMC5396526	R00001	For comparison, we included 162 healthy control subjects and 3 additional patient groups: 56 patients with endocrine-inactive adrenal adenoma; 104 patients with subclinical, mild adrenal cortisol excess; and 47 patients with clinically overt adrenal Cushing syndrome.
PMC5396526	R00004	After analysis of the results from the exploratory cohort, 46 patients were prospectively recruited with consecutive enrollment into the confirmatory cohort that underwent additional pre-and postoperative assessment of cortisol production.
PMC5396526	R01000	A heatmap visualization sorted in the order of increasing excretion of the major aldosterone metabolite tetrahydroaldosterone demonstrated, as expected, a clustering of the primary aldosteronism cases to the right of the heatmap, consistent with increased aldosterone production.
PMC5396526	R01001	Surprisingly, an equivalent heatmap visualizing glucocorticoid output, sorted in the order of increasing cortisol excretion, also demonstrated a clear clustering of primary aldosteronism patients among those with the highest glucocorticoid output.
PMC5396526	R01004	(A) Mineralocorticoid and mineralocorticoid precursor metabolites ordered according to increasing amounts of tetrahydroaldosterone (THAldo) excretion.
PMC5396526	R01005	(B) Glucocorticoid metabolites in order of increasing amounts of cortisol excretion.
PMC5396526	R01007	THA, tetrahydro-11-dehydrocorticosterone; THB, tetrahydrocorticosterone; THDOC, tetrahydro-11-deoxycorticosterone; THF, tetrahydrocortisol; THE, tetrahydrocortisone.
PMC5396526	R01008	As expected, 24-hour tetrahydroaldosterone excretion was significantly increased in primary aldosteronism patients (healthy controls, median 30 [interquartile range 22–44]
PMC5396526	R01012	However, quantitative comparison of steroid excretion between primary aldosteronism patients and healthy controls also revealed 24-hour total glucocorticoid output as significantly increased in primary aldosteronism (11,306 [interquartile range 7,999–14,907]
PMC5396526	R01014	μg/24 h in healthy controls; P < 0.001), with similar findings for cortisol excretion (SI Appendix and ).
PMC5396526	R01015	Both primary aldosteronism subtypes, unilateral aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma and bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, had significantly higher glucocorticoid output than controls, with no significant difference between the 2 disease groups (SI Appendix and ).
PMC5396526	R01016	Similarly, comparison of glucocorticoid excretion in patients with adenomas harboring somatic KCNJ5 mutations (n = 31) did not differ from those with non-KCNJ5 mutations (n = 23) and wild type (n = 34), with significantly increased glucocorticoid excretion in all 3 (data not shown).
PMC5396526	R02000	Correlation analyses adjusted for sex and age revealed 24-hour total glucocorticoid output as significantly correlated with body mass index and markers of insulin resistance (fasting insulin, insulin after oral glucose challenge; homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) in both control subjects and primary aldosteronism (all P < 0.01).
PMC5396526	R02001	However, in primary aldosteronism patients, total glucocorticoid output also significantly correlated with additional parameters of adverse metabolic risk (waist circumference [P < 0.001], high-density lipoprotein
PMC5396526	R02003	By contrast, tetrahydroaldosterone excretion only correlated with systolic blood pressure, albeit above our stringent level of significance (P ≤ 0.01), with a P value of 0.02.
PMC5396526	R03000	To put the extent of glucocorticoid excess into context, we compared glucocorticoid output in the primary aldosteronism patients to that in patients with adrenocortical adenomas that were either endocrine inactive or fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for subclinical and clinically overt Cushing’s syndrome (, SI Appendix, and ).
PMC5396526	R03001	This revealed significantly increased cortisol output in primary aldosteronism that was at least as high as in patients with subclinical Cushing’s syndrome, a group with documented adverse cardiovascular and metabolic consequences due to mild cortisol excess (–).
PMC5396526	R03002	Furthermore, total glucocorticoid excretion was significantly higher in primary aldosteronism (median 11,306 [interquartile range 7,999–14,907]
PMC5396526	R03005	The percentage difference in total glucocorticoid excretion relative to healthy controls was 25.0% (95% CI 14.4, 35.6) in primary aldosteronism and only 3.4% (95% CI –21.4, 28.1) in patients with subclinical Cushing’s syndrome (SI Appendix and ).
PMC5396526	R03006	The panels show the 24-hour urinary excretion of tetrahydroaldosterone (A), cortisol (B), total glucocorticoid metabolites (C), and the major adrenal androgen metabolite 11β-hydroxyandrosterone (D) in primary aldosteronism patients (PA; n = 174) in comparison to healthy controls (Co; n = 162), patients with endocrine-inactive adrenal adenoma (EIA; n = 56), patients with subclinical Cushing’s (differentiated into 2 groups: SC1 (n = 55), morning cortisol after 1 mg dexamethasone overnight > 50 and < 138 nmol/l; SC2 (n = 49), morning cortisol >138 nmol/l), and overt adrenal Cushing’s syndrome patients (Cu; n = 47).
PMC5396526	R03013	The primary aldosteronism group showed significantly increased excretion of all metabolites of the mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid synthesis pathways.
PMC5396526	R03014	Their androgen production largely resembled those in controls but showed an increased excretion of the major adrenal androgen metabolite 11β-hydroxyandrosterone (SI Appendix and ).
PMC5396526	R03016	By contrast, the overt Cushing’s group (SI Appendix and ) showed decreased androgen output in the presence of increased glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid precursor metabolites.
PMC5396526	R03017	The subclinical Cushing’s groups (SI Appendix and ) showed a similar pattern to overt Cushing’s, albeit attenuated with only 2 of 9 glucocorticoid metabolites significantly increased.
PMC5396526	R03018	Patients with primary aldosteronism and overt Cushing’s patients showed significant increases in all 9 glucocorticoid metabolites (SI Appendix and ).
PMC5396526	R04000	Comparing preoperative to postoperative steroid excretion in a cohort of 46 patients with primary aldosteronism due to unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma, we found that following surgical removal of the adenoma, not only tetrahydroaldosterone but also total glucocorticoid output significantly decreased.
PMC5396526	R04001	Similarly, excretion of 11β-hydroxyandrosterone, the metabolite of the major adrenal androgen precursor 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, significantly decreased after surgery (, SI Appendix, and ).
PMC5396526	R04002	Heatmap visualization comparing pre- and postoperative urine steroid metabolomes revealed patient clusters with increased mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid production prior to surgery (SI Appendix and ), but also demonstrated distinct, albeit smaller clusters of patients with preoperatively increased 11β-hydroxyandrosterone (SI Appendix and ).
PMC5396526	R04003	This suggested that the source of glucocorticoid and adrenal androgen excess in these patients was indeed the surgically removed adrenocortical adenoma.
PMC5396526	R04004	The panels show 24-hour urinary excretion of tetrahydroaldosterone (A), cortisol (B), total glucocorticoid metabolites (C), and 11β-hydroxyandrosterone (D).
PMC5396526	R04008	Panels E and F show individual values and mean ± SEM for serum cortisol at baseline and 30 minutes after cosyntropin stimulation in 46 primary aldosteronism patients tested 2 weeks postoperatively, in comparison to 82 healthy controls.
PMC5396526	R04009	The dotted line represents the diagnostic cut-off for adrenal insufficiency (serum cortisol 30 minutes after 250 μg cosyntropin < 15.6 μg/dl
PMC5396526	R04010	[<430 nmol/l], equivalent to the 5th centile of the cortisol response in the 82 healthy controls).
PMC5396526	R05001	We analyzed the expression of CYP11B1, which is required for the synthesis of cortisol and 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione, and CYP11B2, which catalyzes aldosterone synthesis.
PMC5396526	R05002	Results showed that CYP11B1 immunostaining was associated with the excretion of glucocorticoids (P < 0.05) and the major 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione metabolite 11β-hydroxyandrosterone
PMC5396526	R05003	(P < 0.01), but not with tetrahydroaldosterone.
PMC5396526	R05004	Vice versa, CYP11B2 was associated with tetrahydroaldosterone (P < 0.05), but not with glucocorticoid or 11β-hydroxyandrosterone excretion.
PMC5396526	R05005	Of note, tumor morphology consistently differed when comparing adenoma tissues in relation to glucocorticoid output, with a zona fasciculate–type pattern in tissues from patients with the lowest glucocorticoid excretion, and a pattern resembling zona glomerulosa architecture in tissue from patients with the highest glucocorticoid excretion (examples shown in ).
PMC5396526	R05006	A tissue microarray with adenoma tissue from 57 patients was studied by immunohistochemistry for expression of CYP11B1, required for cortisol and 11β-hydroxyandrostenedione synthesis, and CYP11B2, the enzyme responsible for aldosterone synthesis, followed by digital image analysis for quantification of staining intensity.
PMC5396526	R05007	Representative immunohistochemistry examples from 2 patients with in vivo glucocorticoid excretion within the lowest and highest quartiles, respectively, are shown (total original magnification in all panels, ×20).
PMC5396526	R06000	After the analysis of our results suggested that glucocorticoid excess represents a prevalent and highly relevant feature in primary aldosteronism, we prospectively assessed the pre- and postoperative adrenal function in a confirmatory cohort of 46 consecutively recruited patients with unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma.
PMC5396526	R06001	Interestingly, despite significantly increased urinary glucocorticoid output, very few patients showed results indicative of glucocorticoid excess, using either an overnight dexamethasone suppression test or late-night salivary cortisol.
PMC5396526	R06003	Clinically relevant glucocorticoid excess due to an adrenal tumor is typically associated with postoperative suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and hence suppression of function of the contralateral adrenal gland.
PMC5396526	R06004	This results in the need for hydrocortisone replacement in patients with subclinical and overt adrenal Cushing’s syndrome after curative adrenalectomy.
PMC5396526	R06005	Therefore, 46 consecutively recruited patients underwent a cosyntropin stimulation test to assess cortisol reserve 10–14 days after removal of the aldosterone-producing adrenocortical adenoma.
PMC5396526	R06006	Consistent with the evidence of glucocorticoid excess in the steroid metabolome analysis, 13 of 45 (29%) patients failed to appropriately respond to cosyntropin stimulation (serum cortisol 30 minutes after 250 μg ACTH_1–24 < 15.6 μg/dl
PMC5396526	R06007	[<430 nmol/l]), with both baseline and stimulated serum cortisol significantly lower in primary aldosteronism than in 82 healthy controls (P < 0.01).
PMC5398544	A00010	We observed significant changes in molecules that could impact neurologic function during CM; these include increased levels of kynurenate and decreased indolepropionate, glutamate, arginine and glutamine.
PMC5398544	A00011	Moreover, 1-methylimidazoleacetate, kyurenate, arachidonic acid and dimethylarginine were associated with mortality (p < 0.05, fold change > 1.2).
PMC5398544	D00004	A large sequestered biomass of parasites utilize host nutrients including carbons, lipids, purines and amino acids and these processes are accompanied by a catabolic inflammatory host response to alter the blood chemical landscape.
PMC5398544	D00005	Some of the depleted molecules have important neuroprotective roles, such as indolepriopionate and the depletion of other molecules such as glutamate can impair immunologic function.
PMC5398544	D00006	More broadly, we noted a marked depletion of complex phospholipids and an enrichment in fatty acids representing an increase in energetic needs and evidence of liver dysfunction suggested by increases in bile acids.
PMC5398544	D01001	In other conditions, metabolic causes of seizures are associated with abnormal levels of amino acids, purines, carbohydrates, acylcarnitines and urea cycle defects.
PMC5398544	D01002	We found changes in small molecules levels during CM that have been implicated in seizure and/or encephalopathies, including increases in kynurenate and the branch chain amino acids leucine and valine.
PMC5398544	D01003	We also noted a modest elevation in phenylalanine (2.6 fold increase), which has been reported in children and adults with CM and other forms of severe malaria compared to controls; however, the blood concentrations did not approach those seen in phenylketonuria, which results in seizures and other neurological symptoms.
PMC5398544	D01005	A number anti-oxidants were depleted during CM including indolepriopionate a neuroprotective free-radical scavenger which has been shown to provide a neuro protective effect in an animal model of ischemia along with the glutathione precursors, glutamate, and glycine.
PMC5398544	D01007	Glutamate plasma levels were lower during CM compared to convalescence.
PMC5398544	D01009	Treatment with glutamate could potentially improve outcomes as supplemental glutamate increased survival in the animal model of cerebral malaria through modulation of CD8+ effector T cell function.
PMC5398544	D02000	We observed elevated heme degradation products including bilirubin, biliverdin and urobilinogen during CM.
PMC5398544	D02001	Heme is metabolized to biliverdin, then to bilirubin which is transported to the gastrointestinal tract and further metabolized by gut microbiota to urobilinogen.
PMC5398544	D02002	Elevations in heme metabolites can reflect the increase in heme metabolism due the hemolysis of malaria infection and/or liver injury.
PMC5398544	D02004	High levels of bilirubin can cause neurotoxicity (kernicterus), though the impact of its downstream metabolites on brain function is unknown.
PMC5398544	D02009	More broadly, we found a high level of ketone bodies, and an enrichment of fatty acids, with a decrease in lysolipids suggesting a shift to fatty acid metabolism, likely due to increased energetic needs.
PMC5398544	D02010	High levels of catecholamines and pro-inflammatory cytokines during severe malaria may drive the enhanced lipolysis and de novo synthesis of fatty acids to be used for oxidative metabolism.
PMC5398544	D02011	Liver stage parasites require phosphatidylcholine for growth and this may also contribute to decreased blood levels.
PMC5398544	D02013	The reductions in plasma glycine, cysteine, serine, threonine and glutamine during CM could be secondary to parasite uptake and/or host utilization.
PMC5398544	D02014	Arginine was low during CM, and its depletion plays an important role in the vasculopathy of CM.
PMC5398544	D02015	Endothelial dysfunction may be further compounded by high blood levels of dimethylarginine, which can inhibit NO synthesis and was associated with death in our study.
PMC5398544	D03001	Sepsis is also associated with an increase in 2-hydroxybutyrate, phenylalanine and decrease in glutamine, 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphocholine and 1-linoleoylglyerophosphocholine [, ].
PMC5398544	D03002	Furthermore, elevated levels of kynurenate, 1-methylimidazoleacetate and dimethylarginine are associated with mortality in both conditions [–].
PMC5398544	D03003	1-methylimidazoleacetate is a histamine metabolite and histamine elevations have been previously reported during CM.
PMC5398544	D03004	Histamine has been implicated in murine models of CM, with histamine receptor inhibition providing a protective effect.
PMC5398544	D03005	A sepsis study and our data both found metabolites of PLA2 to be associated with death (1-arachidonoyl-GPE (20:4), 1-arachidonoyl-GPC (20:4) in sepsis, and arachidonic acid in CM).
PMC5398544	M00005	Study subjects were treated with intravenous quinine (in accordance with Malawi government treatment guidelines at that time), provided supportive care during their hospitalization and were negative for parasites on blood smears, prior to discharge from the research ward.
PMC5398544	M01004	This assay also quantified phospholipids and sphingolipids.
PMC5398544	R01009	Alpha-ketobutyrate and 2-hydroxybutyrate, degradation products of threonine and methionine metabolism, were highly enriched during CM.
PMC5398544	R01010	We quantified and validated the increase in a subset of amino acids during CM, including branched chained amino acids leucine (211 µM vs 80 µM, p = 0.008) and valine (317 µM vs 117 µM, p = 0.008).
PMC5398544	R01011	Phenylalanine was also increased during CM (128 µM vs 54 µM, p = 0.008), as was tryptophan (53 µM vs 30 µM, p = 0.016).
PMC5398544	R01012	Phenylalanine metabolites 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) lactate, phenyllactate and N-acetylphenylalanine were also enriched during CM, along with tryptophan metabolites kynurenine (6.4 µM vs 1.7 µM, p = 0.008), kynurenate and indolelactate.
PMC5398544	R01019	During CM, we found a depletion in amino acids including arginine (41 µM vs 61 µM p = 0.109), glutamate (36 µM vs 80 µM p = 0.078) and glycine (131 µM vs 278 µM p = 0.008).
PMC5398544	R01020	Citrulline (11 µM vs 27 µM p = 0.008) and ornithine (19 µM vs 48 µM, p = 0.008), metabolic precursors for arginine, the principle substrate for nitric oxide production, were also depleted during CM.
PMC5398544	R01021	Indolepropionate, a tryptophan derivative that acts as a neuroprotective free-radical scavenger, demonstrated a large reduction during CM.
PMC5398544	R01023	Red cell lysis was reflected with a significant enrichment of heme metabolites during CM including elevated biliverdin, bilirubin, L-urobilin, and I-urobilinogen.
PMC5398544	R01025	Arachidonic acid, which is mobilized from membrane lipids by phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and is a precursor for a wide variety of inflammatory mediators such as eicosanoids, was increased during CM compared to convalescence.
PMC5398544	R01026	To further explore and quantify the decrease in complex lipids, we carried out a quantitative analysis in 8 of the 11 paired samples and found a significant depletion of 22 lysolipids and enrichment of 5 species of phosphatidylcholine during CM (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.10) (, ).
PMC5398544	R01028	We found marked reduction in the number of phospholipids and lysolipids during infection and enrichment in fatty acids.
PMC5398544	R01031	Four gamma-glutamyl moieties and thirteen steroids, including cortisone, cortisol and pregnenolone sulfate, were elevated during CM.
PMC5398544	R01032	Quinine and acetaminophen were detected during CM secondary to malaria treatment.
PMC5398544	R02001	363 metabolites were assessed after filtering, and 19 were significantly associated with death (p<0.05), including 1-methylimidazoleacetate, kyurenate, arachidonic acid and dimethylarginine (p < 0.05, fold change > 1.2, ).
PMC5415862	A00005	A marked metabolic reprogramming of EC was observed, including enhanced anaerobic glycolysis and glutaminolysis, inhibited tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and altered lipid metabolism and amino acid turnover.
PMC5415862	A00006	Based on the potential markers of glucose, glutamic acid, lactic acid, and cholesterol, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicated good diagnosis and prognosis of EC.
PMC5415862	A00007	EC patients showed distinct reprogrammed metabolism involved in glycolysis, TCA cycle, glutaminolysis, and fatty acid metabolism.
PMC5415862	D00004	G-6-P, glucose-6-phosphate; Ala, alanine; Trp, tryptophan; Ser, serine; Ile, isoleucine; Leu, leucine; Val, valine; His, histidine; Arg, arginine; Pro, proline; Glu, glutamic acid; Gln, glutamine; Lys, lysine; Met, methionine; Thr, threonine; Asp, aspartic acid; Asn, asparagine; Phe, phenylalanine; Tyr, tyrosine; and Gly, glycine.
PMC5415862	D00006	Apart from previous research, serum and tissues as a whole and ROC curve analysis in the present study identified glucose and lactic acid concentrations as potential biomarkers of EC.
PMC5415862	D00007	The low level of glucose in both EC serum and tissues suggested that cancer cells acquire large quantities of glucose, which accelerates lactic acid accumulation in serum via glycolysis.
PMC5415862	D00008	Lactic acid and pyruvate, which were increased in serum, but decreased in tissues of the EC patients, revealed enhanced gluconeogenesis of EC cells, consistent with gastric cancer.
PMC5415862	D00009	Lactic acid in serum and cancer tissues may indicate poor prognosis in many types of cancers [–].
PMC5415862	D00010	In this study, most intermediates of the TCA cycle accumulated both in EC serum and tissues.
PMC5415862	D00013	This disruption in the TCA cycle further verified the presence of enhanced glycolysis.
PMC5415862	D00014	Glutamine and glutamic acid play important roles in cancer cell proliferation.
PMC5415862	D00015	Glutamic acid is an important energy source via the TCA cycle after conversion to α -ketoglutarate.
PMC5415862	D00016	Besides glutamic acid, glutamine contributes to de novo fatty acid synthesis and serves as a nitrogen source [, ].
PMC5415862	D00017	In this study, glutamine in EC tissues was excessively consumed for the proliferation of cancer cells, resulting in decreased tissue concentrations.
PMC5415862	D00018	The intensive metabolism of glutamine suggested that EC cells require large amounts of glutamic acid from the systemic environment, resulting in decreased serum glutamic acid levels.
PMC5415862	D00019	The results of the present study demonstrated a significant increase in uracil content in EC tissues, which further confirmed that glutaminolysis was an indispensable metabolic pathway of de novo synthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases.
PMC5415862	D00020	In this study, the level of most amino acids, such as tryptophan, serine, isoleucine, leucine, and valine, decreased in EC serum and increased in tissues.
PMC5415862	D00022	In addition to energy production, serine, tryptophan, and glycine supply one carbon unit for synthesis of purines and pyrimidines.
PMC5415862	D00023	The branched-chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine are used as nitrogen sources by cancer cells.
PMC5415862	D00024	Because of the rapid proliferation of cancer cells, copious amounts of asparagine were absorbed by the cancer tissues for production of hereditary material, which led to increased asparagine levels in EC tissues.
PMC5415862	D00025	In this study, we found decreased EC serum and increased tissue tryptophan levels, along with the elevated kynurenic acid concentrations in EC tissues, suggesting an enhanced cancer cell immune escape in EC.
PMC5415862	D00026	In the present study, the EC patients had significantly higher cholesterol levels than the healthy controls.
PMC5415862	D00027	Excessive amounts of nonesterified free cholesterol are required to meet the metabolic requirements of rapidly proliferating cancer cells, which also tend to accelerate the release of free cholesterol from esterified cholesterol.
PMC5415862	D00028	The high cholesterol level in EC serum was in contrast to the findings of previous studies.
PMC5415862	D00029	ROC curve analysis identified cholesterol as a potential biomarker of EC.
PMC5415862	D00030	Generally, concentrations of most free fatty acids (FFAs) are increased in EC serum but decreased in cancer tissues.
PMC5415862	D00031	We presume that the EC cells take in just enough FFAs to promote the release of fatty glyceride.
PMC5415862	D00032	In fact, the depressed 2-hydroxyvaleric levels in EC serum suggested inhibition of β -oxidation of FFAs.
PMC5415862	D00033	The EC patients showed distinct reprogrammed metabolism involved in glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and TCA synthesis.
PMC5415862	M00009	Serum samples were collected in ethylenediaminetetraacetic sodium anticoagulated tubes and then centrifuged at 4000g for 10 min.

PMC5415862	R01001	A total of 61 metabolites in serum and 58 in tissues were identified, which included carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and fatty acids.
PMC5415862	R01008	Parts of the peaks were identified as 1, lactic acid; 2, alanine; 3, valine; 4, leucine; 5, proline; 6, glycine; 7, uracil; 8, fumaric acid; 9, serine; 10, threonine; 11, malic acid; 12, pyroglutamic acid; 13, asparagine; 14, hydroxyproline; 15, creatinine; 16, ornithine; 17, glutamic acid; 18, phenylalanine; 19, ribose; 20, glutamine; 21, hypoxanthine; 22, glucose; 23, hexadecanoic acid; 24, linoleic acid; 25, oleic acid; 26, tryptophan; 27, stearic acid; 28, glucose-6-phosphate; 29, maltose; and 30, cholesterol.
PMC5415862	R02002	The pivotal metabolites in glycolysis, pyruvic acid and lactic acid, showed a reverse tendency, while the level of glucose was low in both serum and tissues of the EC group.
PMC5415862	R02003	The majority of intermediates in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (citric acid, α -ketoglutarate, fumaric acid, and malic acid) were elevated in both serum and tissue samples from the EC patients.
PMC5415862	R02005	Interestingly, we found that the concentrations of most fatty acids were lower in serum collected from the EC patients but showed a reverse tendency in tissues.
PMC5415862	R02006	The levels of cholesterol, myo-inositol-1-phosphate, uracil, and hypoxanthine were higher in both serum and tissues of the EC patients than those of the controls.
PMC5415862	R03001	For example, the cutoff value of glucose was 109.60, with a sensitivity of 83.3%, specificity of 100.0%, and AUC value of 0.952 (95% confidence interval = 0.897–1.000)
PMC5438387	A00003	Application of principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) following receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of NMR data reveals significantly perturbed metabolites: alanine, arginine, methionine, pyruvate, adenine, and uracil.
PMC5438387	D00007	A variety of factors including oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, vascular tone, salt sensitivity, the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) involvement, and the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) influence systemic arterial blood pressure.
PMC5438387	D00008	We observed an increase in serum arginine levels of EH patients compared to HC.
PMC5438387	D00009	This may primarily be attributable to the dynamic flux of arginine and the retarded transport of L-arginine via y+ transporters.
PMC5438387	D00010	Also, the hemodynamics of L-arginine in serum is a representative of the complex interplay/crosstalk between its synthesis via arginosuccinate and lyase and the degradation via arginase, that is, the arginase activity being altered in humans and experimental models of hypertension.
PMC5438387	D00012	A change in L-arginine/NO pathway has been proposed as a causative factor of hypertension.
PMC5438387	D00014	L-arginine is well known for its vasodilating affect mediated by endothelial derived nitric oxide synthase in mammals.
PMC5438387	D00016	An important factor that needs consideration is arginine paradox.
PMC5438387	D00017	Arginine paradox is a phenomenon where on one hand; arginine supplementation improves NO mediated vasodilation; while the arginine reserves remain above the Michelis-Menten constant, k_m for nitric oxide synthase.
PMC5438387	D00019	A number of explanations were later on sought to answer the arginine paradox including altered arginase, LDL mediated impaired L-arginine transport to endothelial cells, compartmentalization of L-arginine and involvement of NOS inhibitors like asymmetric dimethyl arginine (ADMA) and monomethyl arginine (L-NMMA).
PMC5438387	D00020	Although all these studies supported the idea of involvement of perturbed arginine levels in hypertension, the findings came either from animal model, cell-lines or a limited number of patients with certain co-morbid condition.
PMC5438387	D00021	As far as our results are concerned, the most relevant explanation seems to be the involvement of ADMA.
PMC5438387	D00022	ADMA operates by inhibiting competitively for NO synthase, thereby decreasing NO bioavailability, despite high L-arginine concentrations.
PMC5438387	D00023	ADMA is released from hydrolysis of post-translationally methylated proteins.
PMC5438387	D00024	It is assumed that the reduced activity of the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) results in elevated ADMA concentration.
PMC5438387	D00025	Attenuation of DDAH activity is influenced by factors like oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, inflammatory cytokines, hyperhomocysteinemia and hyperglycemia, thereby causing accumulation of ADMA and subsequent reduced NO synthesis.
PMC5438387	D00026	Moreover, plasma ADMA levels have been reported to be increase in hypertensive individuals.
PMC5438387	D00027	ADMA has been shown in experimental and clinical studies to play an important role in perturbing arterial pressure.
PMC5438387	D00028	Also, determining L-arginine to ADMA ratio has been advocated.
PMC5438387	D00031	In addition, nitric oxide itself works in many dimensions.
PMC5438387	D00032	Apart from the conventional vasodilation property, the reaction of NO with reactive oxygen species leads to formation of peroxynitrite formation.
PMC5438387	D00035	Moreover, the combined action of NO and peroxynitrite radicals have been reported for diverse actions on lipids, DNA and held responsible for a variety of pathogenic mechanisms.
PMC5438387	D00037	Increased insulin levels as a result of insulin resistance also play a dynamic role in L-arginine and NO pathway.
PMC5438387	D00039	Still, the bioavailability of NO is determined by mutual contrasting factors whereby arginine promotes insulin release from beta cells of pancreas and insulin stimulates arginine cellular uptake resulting in NO mediated vasodilation.
PMC5438387	D00040	Another fact that requires a special mention in context of the results of this study is the NO mediated inhibition of methionine synthase.
PMC5438387	D00041	Both in vitro  and in vivo , methionine synthase has been shown to be inhibited, thus restricting methionine biosynthesis.
PMC5438387	D00042	This is yet another evidence of importance of methionine as a key descriptor in EH pathology worked out from human samples.
PMC5438387	D00043	Methionine is sulphur containing essential amino acid.
PMC5438387	D00044	A decreased level of methionine with a corresponding increase in homocysteine levels in EH patients as compared to HC may reflect a trend towards increased conversion of methionine to homocysteine which agrees with earlier findings establishing the role of homocysteine in aggravating hypertension mediated by diminished NO bioavailability.
PMC5438387	D00045	Also, methionine supplementation has been proved to exhibit vasoconstriction, thereby providing an indirect proof that methionine near absence levels in EH patients’ NMR profiles is a reflection of manifested high blood pressure.
PMC5438387	D00048	Here, the present study offer a clear picture of elevated levels of homocysteine and consequent diminished levels of methionine in EH patients, thus justifying their role as bio-signatures.
PMC5438387	D00049	Moreover, evidence of increased S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH) and decreased S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) levels in hypertensive patients’ support to the outcome of NMR derived metabolomics.
PMC5438387	D00050	These perturbed levels of SAM and SAH indicate switching off methionine salvage pathways to adenine metabolism, which is indicated in the NMR spectra of EH subjects in accordance with KEGG pathways (M00034; map 00270).
PMC5438387	D00051	A perturbation in adenine levels has also been supported by its role in precipitating essential hypertension and aortic stiffness.
PMC5438387	D00053	L-alanine shows a diminishing effect on release of nor-epinephrine from cardiac sympathetic nerves in animal models, resulting in blood pressure elevation.
PMC5438387	D00054	This effect is mediated by alpha receptors of norepinephrine.
PMC5438387	D00055	Thus, modulation of cardiovascular responses and circulating catecholamines seems responsible for alanine’s role in blood pressure elevation.
PMC5438387	D00056	Apart from this, L-alanine’s interaction with insulin also influences arterial blood pressure.
PMC5438387	D00057	The insulinotropic effect of L-alanine is reported to operate either via co-transport of Na_+ ions and increased ATP production or Ca_2+ ion-uptake.
PMC5438387	D00058	Thus, L-alanine consumption leads to insulin release, thereby affecting blood pressure.
PMC5438387	D00059	Moreover, urinary alanine levels have been linked with hypertension in INTERMAP epidemiological study.
PMC5438387	D00060	This indeed is a reflection that alanine biochemistry is an integral part of human physiology and may be controlling the hypertension through aspects like impaired insulin resistance or imbalance between renal transport and transport along the muscle-liver axis.
PMC5438387	D00061	Although conflicting evidence exists relating the levels of alanine aminotransferase in hypertensive patients, the decreased level of alanine along with a parallel decrease in pyruvate levels in EH compared to HC may be a manifestation of a dynamic balance between aminotransferase reaction in muscle and liver.
PMC5438387	D00062	Moreover, the decline in pyruvate levels has been supported in previous study conducted on a limited number of hypertensive individuals.
PMC5438387	D00065	Our observations reveals an inherent uniqueness since alanine and pyruvate levels have been described as playing important role in manifestation of EH, unlike its sub types or variants.
PMC5438387	D00066	Uracil has been shown to possess an antihypertensive property, and the near absence of this in EH patients may follow from this property.
PMC5438387	D00069	Urapidil is a derivative of uracil that has also been used as an antihypertensive drug, exhibits the connection of uracil in perturbed metabolism during essential hypertension.
PMC5438387	D00071	Of note, many positive or negative feedback mechanisms related with arginine, NO, ADMA, insulin, ROS, ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) operate and any alteration could result in elevated blood pressure.
PMC5438387	D00072	However, prime discussion is concerning ROS and ADMA resulting in decreased NO bioavailability.
PMC5438387	D00073	Also, adenine incorporation in place of guanine in angiotensinogen promoter is reported to be associated with essential hypertension, thereby relating with decreased concentration of adenine in EH milieu of our NMR data.

PMC5438387	D00076	Arginine, methionine, adenine, uracil, alanine, and pyruvate metabolites exhibit conspicuous peaks in NMR-derived metabolic profile, thus enabling quantitative assessment.
PMC5438387	M01000	A medical history and clinical parameters were obtained from all study subjects including age, blood pressure levels, presence of any definite cause of hypertension, serum creatinine and urea levels, lipid profile, Na_+ and K_+ levels, symptoms of hypertension and family history.
PMC5438387	M01014	Also, to search for any secondary cause of hypertension, the patients were advised to obtain for a set of biochemical tests including electrolyte levels (Na_+ , K_+ ), glycosylated hemoglobin, blood urea, serum creatinine, lipid profile, hematocrite and urinalysis.
PMC5438387	M01035	Centrifugal filters (3 kDa cutoff; Vivospin Turbo 4, VS04T91, Sartorius) were first washed with 1000 μl phosphate buffer in triple distilled water at 10,000 rpm for 30 min.
PMC5438387	M02005	Centrifugal filters (3 kDa cutoff; Vivospin Turbo 4, VS04T91, Sartorius) were first washed with 1000 μl phosphate buffer in triple distilled water at 10,000 rpm for 30 min.
PMC5438387	M03002	Trimethylsilyl propionic acid sodium salt (TSP) (50 µL of 1.25 mmol/l) deuterated at CH2 group was employed for the deuterium lock, external reference, and standard signal for the quantification of metabolites.
PMC5438387	M04000	To facilitate data analysis, each NMR spectrum was aligned to the methyl peak of alanine (1.45 ppm, doublet) followed by generation of spectral bins.
PMC5438387	R02001	The human metabolome database (http://www.hmdb.ca) and various recently published studies were used to assign the metabolites such as different types of amino acids, nucleic acids, monosaccharides, energetic related molecules (pyruvate, lactate, citrate, creatinine) as well as amines and choline’s present in EH and HC filtered serum samples.
PMC5438387	R02005	(c) Spectral analysis of filtered serum reveals that among the plethora of metabolites, only six metabolites (alanine, pyruvate, methionine, arginine, adenine, and uracil) were playing a significant role to segregate and classify EH from HC cohorts.
PMC5438387	R02006	(d) The subsequent analysis demonstrated up-regulation of arginine and down-regulation of alanine, pyruvate, methionine, adenine, and uracil in EH compared to HC.
PMC5438387	R02019	Regression analysis of serum metabolomics derived six biomarkers with diastolic blood pressure revealed excellent correlation in the group of isolated DBP: DBP vs. alanine (R _2  = 0.35), DBP vs. arginine (R _2  = 0.56), DBP vs. methionine (R _2  = 0.64), DBP vs. pyruvate (R _2  = 0.78), DBP vs. adenine (R _2  = 0.77), and DBP vs. uracil (R _2  = 0.73) (Figure _S1 ).
PMC5438387	R02021	The correlation values were: SBP vs. alanine (R _2  = 0.39), SBP vs. arginine (R _2  = 0.50), SBP vs. methionine (R _2  = 0.68), SBP vs. pyruvate (R _2  = 0.77), SBP vs. adenine (R _2  = 0.78), and SBP vs. uracil
PMC5438387	R02023	(Figure _S2 ) while DBP vs. alanine (R _2  = 0.38), DBP vs. arginine (R _2  = 0.50), DBP vs. methionine (R _2  = 0.59), DBP vs. pyruvate (R _2  = 0.69), DBP vs. adenine (R _2  = 0.73), and DBP vs. uracil (R _2  = 0.69)
PMC5448546	A00004	Targeted profiling of 63 metabolites (acylcarnitines, amino acids, and ketones) was performed using tandem flow injection mass spectrometry.
PMC5448546	A00006	In adjusted models, the metabolite factor loaded with long-chain acylcarnitines was higher in all PH cases versus non-PH controls (P  = 0.00008), but did not discriminate between CpcPH and postcapillary PH (P  = 0.56).
PMC5448546	A00007	In analyses of subtypes, CpcPH patients had lower levels of factors loaded with urea cycle amino acids and short chain acylcarnitines as compared to controls (P  = 0.002 and P  = 0.01, respectively) and as compared to postcapillary PH (P  = 0.04 and P  = 0.02, respectively).
PMC5448546	A00008	Compared to controls, PH was strongly associated with greater concentrations of long-chain acylcarnitines.
PMC5448546	A02019	In both failing left and right hearts, as mitochondrial metabolism is actively suppressed,_, a shift occurs from the highly efficient fatty acid oxidation to glucose metabolism and glycolysis.
PMC5448546	A02020	The resultant increase in lactate production and acidosis further impairs cardiac function.
PMC5448546	A02023	Thus, we hypothesized that circulating metabolites reflecting mitochondrial energetics—including amino acids, acylcarnitines, and ketones—would discriminate PH from non-PH controls, subtypes of PH associated with left heart disease from non-PH controls, and between postcapillary PH and CpcPH in a discovery cohort.
PMC5448546	D00001	Our most significant finding was for higher levels of circulating long-chain acylcarnitines (factor 4) in patients with PH as compared with controls without PH even after adjustment for many clinical variables, a finding that met rigorous adjustment for multiple comparisons overall and was significant in comparisons of each PH subtype with controls.
PMC5448546	D00003	Our second most significant finding was for urea cycle metabolites (factor 8), with lower levels in PH patients than no-PH controls, and differentiating PH subtypes in left heart disease with CpcPH having the lowest levels overall.
PMC5448546	D00005	The non-failing heart primarily utilizes long-chain fatty acids as an energy source, and an early step in their oxidation in the mitochondria is the formation of long-chain acylcarnitines.
PMC5448546	D00006	In our study, the increased levels of long-chain acylcarnitines (factor 4, ) seen across the PH subtypes as compared with no-PH potentially reflects the inefficiencies in mitochondrial fuel metabolism previously described in both left and right ventricular failure.
PMC5448546	D00008	Similar abnormalities in long-chain acylcarnitine levels have been noted in left heart failure including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and improve with ventricular assist device therapy.
PMC5448546	D00010	This suggests that abnormalities in long-chain acylcarnitines reflect a common signature associated with myocardial mitochondrial dysfunction.
PMC5448546	D00011	Normalized concentrations of long-chain acylcarnitines in PH hemodynamic subgroups.
PMC5448546	D00014	The other nominally significant results included results for factor 2, comprised of long-chain dicarboxylacylcarnitines, unique in being the only factor which was only different in CpcPH compared to controls.
PMC5448546	D00015	Dicarboxylated acylcarnitines are derivatives of mitochondrial lipid or amino acid oxidation and a product of omega-oxidation by microsomal cytochrome p450 enzymes in peroxisomes.
PMC5448546	D00016	We have previously described a strong association of similar dicarboxyl acylcarnitines with cardiovascular events in a cardiovascular disease cohort.
PMC5448546	D00017	The precise substrates and pathways that generate the dicarboxylated acylcarnitines and factors that foster their production require further investigation.
PMC5448546	D00018	Urea cycle amino acids (factor 8) were lower in CpcPH compared to postcapillary PH patients as well as controls.
PMC5448546	D00019	This factor is strongly weighted by glycine and may be reporting on subsequent degradation to ammonia and entry into the urea cycle.
PMC5448546	D00021	Recent data have linked increased glycine levels and decreased urea cycle metabolites with a chromosomal locus and identified a strong association with decreased risk of atherosclerosis.
PMC5448546	D00022	Glycine may have cardioprotective properties against coronary arterial endothelial cell inflammation, further supporting the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility can lead to a differential response to cardiopulmonary vascular inflammation and stress.
PMC5448546	D00024	In a recent study using an alternative targeted metabolomics platform, differences in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-dependent tryptophan metabolites, tricarboxylic acid intermediates, purine metabolites, and arginine-nitric oxide metabolic pathway constituents were associated with right ventricular–pulmonary vascular dysfunction.
PMC5448546	D00025	In future studies, combining multiple biomarkers reflecting the many pathways dysregulated in pulmonary vascular disease—including the nitric oxide pathway, mitochondrial bioenergetics, and vasoactive mediators—could provide additional insight into left heart disease associated PH.
PMC5448546	D00030	The use of PCA mitigates the number of multiple comparisons by reducing a large number of metabolites into unrelated groupings in an unbiased manner, and our primary finding for long-chain acylcarnitines survives adjustment for a conservative correction for multiple comparisons.
PMC5448546	M01000	As previously described, we used targeted, quantitative tandem flow injection mass spectrometry (MS/MS) to determine levels of 60 metabolites (45 acylcarnitines and 15 amino acids) and standard assays for measurement of ketones, β-hydroxybutyrate, and non-esterified fatty acids._, For MS/MS analyses, plasma samples were spiked with a cocktail of heavy-isotope internal standards (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, MA, USA; CDN Isotopes, Canada) and deproteinated with methanol.
PMC5448546	M01001	The aliquoted supernatant was dried and esterified with hot, acidic methanol (acylcarnities) or n- butanol (amino acids).
PMC5448546	M01002	Tandem MS/MS using a Waters TQD (Milford, MA, USA) was employed to quantitatively assess acylcarnitine and amino acid ester concentrations.
PMC5448546	M01003	Total ketones (KET), 3-hydroxybutyrate (HBUT), and total non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) were measured on a Beckman DxC600 autoanalyzer (Brea, CA, USA) using reagents from Wako (Richmond, VA, USA).
PMC5448546	M02004	Factor 5 (ketone-related analytes) was also adjusted for preoperative heparin status, as heparin is known to affect β-hydroxybutyrate, ketone, fatty acid, and triglyceride levels.
PMC5448546	M02012	ALA, alanine; ARG, arginine; ASX, aspartic acid/asparagine; CIT, citrulline; GLX, glutamine/glutamate; GLY, glycine; HBUT, beta-hydroxybutyrate; HIS, histidine; KET, ketones; LEU/ILE, leucine/isoleucine; MET, methionine; NEFA, non-esterified fatty acids; ORN, ornithine; PHE, phenylalanine; PRO, proline; SER, serine; TYR, tyrosine; VAL, valine.
PMC5448546	R01002	In multivariable models, factor 4 (long-chain acylcarnitines, nominal P  = 0.00008) was significantly different between PH cases and PH controls after Bonferroni adjustment (P  < 0.0035) with higher levels in PH cases.
PMC5448546	R01003	Six additional factors were nominally significantly different between PH cases and non-PH controls: factor 6 (medium-chain acylcarnitines, P  = 0.009) levels were higher in PH cases and factors 8 (urea cycle amino acids, P  = 0.007), factor 9 (C3-C5 acylcarnitines, P  = 0.04), factor 11 (histidine, arginine, C18:2-OH and C5:1 acylcarnitines; P  = 0.04), factor 12 (glutamate/glutamine, valine; P  = 0.006), and factor 14 (C22 acylcarnitine, P  = 0.004) were all lower in PH cases compared to controls.
PMC5448546	R02000	In comparing PH associated with left heart disease subtypes to no-PH controls, the most significant results revealed that both postcapillary PH and CpcPH groups individually continued to show higher mean levels of factor 4 than no-PH controls (long-chain acylcarnitines, P  = 0.00001 and P  = 0.002, respectively).
PMC5448546	R02001	Individuals with postcapillary PH also had lower mean levels of factor 5 (ketone-related metabolites, P  = 0.04) and factor 14 (C22 acylcarnitine, P  = 0.01).
PMC5448546	R02002	Individuals with CpcPH also demonstrated higher factor 2 levels (long-chain dicarboxyacylcarnitines, P  = 0.01) and lower factor 8 (urea cycle amino acids, P  = 0.005), factor 9 (C3-C5 acylcarnitines, P  = 0.01), factor 12 (glycine and valine, P  = 0.04), and factor 14 (C22 acylcarnitine, P  = 0.04).
PMC5448546	R02004	Instead, when compared to postcapillary PH patients, CpcPH patients exhibited higher factor 5 levels (ketone-related metabolites, P  = 0.04), but lower factor 8 (urea cycle amino acids, P  = 0.04) and factor 9 (C3-C5 acylcarnitines, P  = 0.02) levels.
PMC5473163	A00000	Furan, a possible human carcinogen, is found in heat treated foods and tobacco smoke.
PMC5473163	A00001	Previous studies have shown that humans are capable of converting furan to its reactive metabolite, cis -2-butene-1,4-dial (BDA), and therefore may be susceptible to furan toxicity.
PMC5473163	A00002	Human risk assessment of furan exposure has been stymied because of the lack of mechanism-based exposure biomarkers.
PMC5473163	A00003	Therefore, a sensitive LC-MS/MS assay for six furan metabolites was applied to measure their levels in urine from furan-exposed rodents as well as in human urine from smokers and nonsmokers.
PMC5473163	A00004	The metabolites that result from direct reaction of BDA with lysine (BDA-N _α -acetyllysine) and from cysteine-BDA-lysine cross-links (N -acetylcysteine-BDA-lysine, N -acetylcysteine-BDA-N _α -acetyllysine and their sulfoxides) were targeted in this study.
PMC5473163	A00005	Five of the six metabolites were identified in urine from rodents treated with furan by gavage.
PMC5473163	A00006	BDA-N _α -acetyllysine, N -acetylcysteine-BDA-lysine and its sulfoxide were detected in most human urine samples from three different groups.
PMC5473163	A00007	The levels of N -acetylcysteine-BDA-lysine sulfoxide were more than 10 times higher than the corresponding sulfide in many samples.
PMC5473163	A01000	furan, biomarker, tobacco smoke, mercapturic acid, sulfoxide,
PMC5473163	A01001	lysine adduct
PMC5473163	D00000	Previous studies in rats indicated that abundant urinary metabolites of furan were derived from the reaction of BDA with lysine and cysteine.
PMC5473163	D00001	Metabolites 1 and 6 are products of the reaction of BDA with lysine whereas metabolites 2 – 5 are derived from the crosslinking of cysteine to lysine by this reactive compound.
PMC5473163	D00002	In this report, five of these six furan metabolites were detected in urine of furan-treated rodents (metabolites 1 – 5) and four were detected in most human urine samples (metabolites 1, 2, 3 and 6).
PMC5473163	D00003	While the cysteine-BDA-lysine derived metabolites, sulfide 4 and sulfoxide 5 were identified as major furan metabolites in rat urine using non-quantitative mass spectrometry methods,_, the quantitative assay presented in this report indicates that the BDA-lysine metabolite 1 is actually more abundant than both the sulfide 4 and sulfoxide 5.
PMC5473163	D00005	The total sum of cysteine-BDA-lysine derived metabolites (2 – 5) was less than the BDA-lysine metabolite 1.
PMC5473163	D00006	This finding was somewhat surprising given that studies in rat hepatocytes indicated that the formation of glutathione-BDA-lysine metabolites occurred to a much greater extent than metabolite 1;_, glutathione-BDA-lysine is likely a major precursor to metabolites 2 – 5._, A likely explanation for this discrepancy is that we are not accounting for all of the cysteine-BDA-lysine-derived metabolites reported in rat urine.
PMC5473163	D00007	The cysteine derivative can be metabolized by sequentially by β-lysase, S -methyltransferase and sulfur oxidases, respectively, whereas the lysine residue can undergo oxidative deamination.
PMC5473163	D00011	In this species, the cysteine-BDA-lysine derived sulfide 2 is more abundant than the BDA-lysine reaction product 1, suggesting that cysteine-BDA-lysine cross-link formation is more abundant than direct BDA-lysine adduct formation.
PMC5473163	D00012	This is consistent with our previous observations of the relative formation of metabolite 1 and glutathione-BDA-lysine in mouse hepatocytes.
PMC5473163	D00013	The higher levels of metabolites 2 and 3 in the urine of mice relative to rats indicate that the cysteine and lysine residues of the cross-link are less susceptible to further metabolism in mice.
PMC5473163	D00014	Analysis by ion trap mass spectrometry indicated that the metabolic profile of furan metabolites in mice was much simpler than that observed for rats and there was little evidence of any further metabolism of the cysteine and lysine portions of this cross-link beyond acetylation of the lysine residue and S -oxidation (data not shown).
PMC5473163	D00016	Furan metabolites 1, sulfide 2 and sulfoxide 3 were detected in all but two of the human samples; significantly lower levels of sulfide 4 and sulfoxide 5 were detected in only some human samples.
PMC5473163	D00017	Unlike rodents, the non-acetylated BDA-lysine metabolite 6 was also present.
PMC5473163	D00018	The acetylated BDA-lysine compound 1 was the most abundant furan metabolite detected in the human samples, consistent with the observation that this direct reaction product was the dominant BDA-derived metabolite of furan in human hepatocytes.
PMC5473163	D00019	The sulfoxide metabolite 3 was the second most abundant BDA-derived reaction product detected in most of the human samples; however, sulfide 2 was more abundant than the sulfoxide 3 in some of the samples.
PMC5473163	D00021	The observation that the sulfoxide 3 was more abundant than the corresponding mercapturic acid in all of the POB samples and more than half of the Asian co-hort samples is a novel finding.
PMC5473163	D00022	While mercapturic acid sulfoxides have been reported for a number of compounds in rodent urine, most human urinary biomarker studies focus on the mercapturic acid metabolites of environmental chemicals.
PMC5473163	D00023	The oxidation of the mercapturic acid 2 to the sulfoxide 3 likely results from an enzyme-mediated process since the ratio of the two diastereomers was ~11/1
PMC5473163	D00027	This evidence supports the hypothesis that the sulfoxide 3 detected in urine is formed enzymatically and not as a result of air oxidation.
PMC5473163	D00028	Cytochrome P450 and flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) are two enzymes capable of oxidizing mercapturic acids to their sulfoxides, with CYP3A enzymes being the most active.
PMC5473163	D00034	This decline differed from the immediate drop observed for the mercapturic acid derivatives of other tobacco smoke chemicals such as benzene, butadiene and acrolein.
PMC5473163	D00036	The abundance of furan in tobacco smoke supports furan as the precursor to metabolites 1, 3 and 6 in smoker’s urine.
PMC5473163	D00037	_– However, other sources cannot be excluded since there are other potential sources of BDA.
PMC5473163	D00038	First, BDA itself may be a component of tobacco smoke.
PMC5473163	D00039	This question has not been examined but other α,β-unsaturated aldehydes have been detected in tobacco smoke.
PMC5473163	D00041	Finally, BDA may be endogenously generated by radicals and reactive oxygen species-generating chemicals;_– both of which are abundant in cigarette smoke.
PMC5473163	D00042	Radical reactions with DNA generate the trans-isomer of BDA and BDA has been proposed to be a product of lipid peroxidation.
PMC5473163	D00043	Acrolein and crotonaldehyde are also both present in tobacco smoke and are formed as a consequence of lipid peroxidation.
PMC5473163	D00044	These compounds are both α,β-unsaturated aldehydes like BDA.
PMC5473163	D00045	It is interesting to note that their metabolites, HPMA and HMPMA, are correlated with metabolite 3 in the POB study samples.
PMC5473163	D00046	Further studies need to be conducted to clarify all the possible sources of BDA that result from tobacco smoking.
PMC5473163	D00048	Humans are also exposed to furan through processed food, pollution, car exhaust and wood smoke.
PMC5473163	D00054	In summary, a sensitive LC-MS/MS assay was employed to detect potential furan metabolites in human urine.
PMC5473163	D00055	Several of these metabolites, 1, 3 and 6 were associated with smoking in humans, and therefore should also be explored as potential biomarkers of exposure to BDA and, possibly furan.
PMC5473163	D00056	Future studies will be performed with these biomarkers to determine if their levels are associated with adverse health effects associated with exposure to mixtures containing furan such as tobacco smoke.
PMC5473163	M01002	F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice were selected for these studies because they have been used to assess furan toxicity in numerous short and long term studies.
PMC5473163	M01003	_– Male and female B6C3F1 mice have similar biochemical, proliferative and toxic responses to the hepatic effects of furan._, Female mice were used because previous in vivo studies were carried out in this fashion.
PMC5473163	M01004	Male rats are more sensitive to the hepatocellular carcinogenic properties of furan.
PMC5473163	M01006	_– Two groups of five mice received 0 or 8 mg/kg furan (n = 5) in 5 mL/kg corn oil by gavage.
PMC5473163	M01009	Male F344 rats were given 0, 8 or 40 mg/kg furan in 5 mL corn oil by gavage as previously described.
PMC5473163	M02003	_, The Singapore samples were previously treated with ascorbic acid (0.4 g/20 mL urine).
PMC5473163	M02005	All urine had been stored at −20° C. Creatinine in the urine samples was measured using a colorimetric microplate assay (CRE34-K01) purchased from Eagle Bioscience (Nashua, NH).
PMC5473163	M02006	Cotinine, a measure of nicotine intake, was measured in the baseline POB study samples using an established GC-MS method.
PMC5473163	M03003	After 45 min at room temperature, these acetylated urine samples were applied to Oasis MAX cartridges (60 mg, Waters, Milford, MA) after the cartridges had been conditioned with 2 mL each of methanol and 2% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide.
PMC5473163	M03004	Furan metabolites were eluted from the cartridge with 1% (v/v) formic acid containing 40% (v/v) methanol (1, 6 as [_2 H_3 ]1, [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]1, 5, 3 as [_2 H_3 ]5, and [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]5) and 100% methanol (4, [_2 H_3 ]4, [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]4 and [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]2 as [_13 C_6 _2 H_3 _15 N_2 ]4).
PMC5473163	M03005	Fractions were collected in the presence of 15 mM ammonium acetate (200 μL) in glass vials.
PMC5473163	M03007	Following acidification with 500 μL of 1% (v/v) formic acid, the fractions were individually applied to Sep-Pak® Vac 18 cartridges (50 mg, Waters) that were preconditioned with 2 mL each methanol and water.
PMC5473163	M03008	Metabolites were eluted with 1 mL each 15% (v/v) (1, 6 as [_2 H_3 ]1, [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]1, 5, 3 as [_2 H_3 ]5, and [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]5) and 30% (v/v) methanol (4, 2 as [_2 H_3 ]4, [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]4, and [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]2 as [_13 C_6 _2 H_3 _15 N_2 ]4).
PMC5473163	M03009	Eluents were collected in the presence of 15 mM ammonium acetate (200 μL) in glass vials, then immediately concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure.
PMC5473163	M04000	Samples were reconstituted in 100 μL of 15 mM ammonium acetate containing 1% (v/v) methanol for LC-MS/MS analysis.
PMC5473163	M04001	Levels of furan metabolites were measured on a Thermo Scientific TSQ Vantage mass spectrometer attached to an Eksigent nanoLC-ultra 2D pump and autosampler system using established selected reaction monitoring parameters for these metabolites._, The mixtures (8 μL) were separated on a Phenomenex Synergi Hydro-RP column (250 mm × 0.5 mm, 80 Å pore size 4 μm) eluting with 15 mM ammonium acetate (solvent A) with a methanol (solvent B) gradient at a flow rate of 10 μL/min.
PMC5473163	M04012	Urinary metabolite levels were standardized to creatinine levels in the urine for each sample.
PMC5473163	M06003	The tobacco constituent biomarkers were: cigarettes smoked per day, cotinine, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol (NNAL), 1-hydroxypyrene (HOP), 2-hydroxyethyl mercapturic acid (HEMA), 1-(N -acetylcysteinyl)-2-hydroxy-3-butene (MHBMA), 1,2-dihydroxy-4-(N -acetylcysteinyl)butane (DHBMA), 1-(N -acetylcysteinyl)-propan-3-ol (HPMA), 2-(N -acetylcysteinyl)butan-4-ol (HMPMA), and (N -acetylcysteinyl)benzene (SPMA).
PMC5473163	R00001	Application of these methods to urine required more extensive sample clean up prior to the mass spectral analysis so we adapted a published method for the detection of urinary mercapturic acid metabolites of tobacco smoke constituents for our purposes.
PMC5473163	R00005	Conversion was considered to be close to 100% as judged by the absence of un-derivatized 2 in the urine samples treated with acetic anhydride.
PMC5473163	R00008	The [_2 H_3 ]acetylation reaction also resulted in the conversion of the BDA-lysine reaction product 6 to [_2 H_3 ]1 and metabolite 3 to [_2 H_3 ]5.
PMC5473163	R00011	The first fraction which was eluted with 40% (v/v) methanol contained 1, 6 (as [_2 H_3 ]1), 3 (as [_2 H_3 ]5) and 5.
PMC5473163	R00012	The second, less polar, fraction eluted with 100% methanol contained 2 (as [_2 H_3 ]4) and 4.
PMC5473163	R00016	Urinary furan metabolites were initially identified by spiking the urine samples with stable isotopically labeled forms of the metabolites, [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]1, [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]2, [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]4, and [_13 C_6 _15 N_2 ]5 and investigating whether there were unlabeled forms of the metabolites in the urine samples that co-eluted with the internal standards.
PMC5473163	R00026	Furan biomarkers in various human study groups The identities of the human metabolites 1, 2 and 3 were further confirmed with high resolution LC-MS/MS.
PMC5473163	R00032	Quantification of these metabolites in human urine indicated that BDA-lysine metabolite 1 was the most abundant metabolite in all samples.
PMC5473163	R00033	In the POB study, the relative levels were: 1 > sulfoxide 3 > sulfide 2.
PMC5473163	R00034	In the Asian cohorts, the relative levels were BDA-N-acetyl-lysine metabolite 1 > sulfide 2 and sulfoxide 3.
PMC5473163	R00035	The relative levels of 2 and 3 depended on the individuals in this group with sulfide 2 was greater than sulfoxide 3 in some individuals and 3 was more abundant than 2 in others.
PMC5473163	R00040	Urinary levels of sulfoxide 3 were elevated in smokers as compared to non-smokers in all three cohorts ( and and ).
PMC5473163	R00041	Levels of the lysine metabolites 6 (measured as [_2 H_3 ]1) and 1 were also elevated in smokers relative to non-smokers in the Singapore and Shanghai cohort samples ( and ).
PMC5473163	R00043	Consistent with the association of sulfoxide 3 levels with smoking in this group, the levels of this metabolite decreased significantly following smoking cessation (p -value < 0.0001, ).
PMC5473163	R00048	Data is presented as average urinary level normalized to creatinine ± S.D.

PMC5591409	D00000	The present study in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy shows that the concentrations of glucose, citrate, and lactate are decreased and ketone bodies (3-OH-butyrate, acetate, acetoacetate, and acetone) increased compared to R patients with epilepsy and controls.
PMC5591409	D00001	At first glance, our result appears in line with the observations that, in cases of refractory epilepsy, the energetic failure is reflected by uncompensated brain glucose levels.
PMC5591409	D00005	The reduction of citrate, glucose, and lactate concentrations in NR patients compared with R and C patients suggest a switch from glucose metabolism, the suitable energetic substrate of the brain, to ketogenic metabolites.
PMC5591409	D00006	Indeed, previous studies reported similar variations including a reduction in _13 C-labeled citrate in an experimental seizure model in the hippocampus (, ).
PMC5591409	D00007	It is also worth noting that in these studies the concentrations of citrate and glucose showed a parallel decrease similar to the lactate profile.
PMC5591409	D00010	Moreover, as glutamate and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), respectively, are the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in the brain several studies focused their main issues on how KBs affect levels of these neurotransmitters and their receptor activity.
PMC5591409	D00011	Following magnetic resonance spectroscopy investigations, it has been demonstrated that increased levels of GABA neurotransmission are detected in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with KD (, ) underlining a possible action of ketone bodies upon the modulation of GABA-A receptors by increasing the synaptic inhibition (, ).
PMC5591409	D00012	The increase of synaptic inhibition might not be per se sufficient in contrasting AEDs-resistant epileptogenesis since the brain networks under sustained seizure activity show a poor affinity of GABA receptors (, ).

PMC5591409	R00032	2-OH-butyrate and 2-OH-valerate were not quantified because signals overlapped in the same spectral region (triplet at 0.92 ppm).

PMC5618317	D00009	Carnitine (HMDB00062) and succinic acid (HMDB00254) have previously been found to be associated with colorectal cancer.
PMC5618317	D00010	Additionally, ascorbic acid (HMDB00044) has been linked to other kinds of cancers.
PMC5618317	D00011	Carnitine is necessary for fatty acid oxidation and transporting fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondria, where it is broken down via the citric acid cycle to release energy.
PMC5618317	D00012	In humans, most of the carnitine in the body comes from dietary sources such as red meat and dairy products.
PMC5618317	D00013	About 25% of carnitine is synthesized in the liver, kidney, and brain from the amino acids lysine and methionine.
PMC5618317	D00014	Interestingly, the final step of carnitine synthesis pathway occurs as 4-trimethylammoniobutanoic acid is transformed into carnitine via the enzyme gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase where ascorbic acid acts as coenzyme and succinic acid gets produced.
PMC5618317	D00015	Succinic acid is a dicarboxylic acid.
PMC5618317	D00016	The anion, succinate, is a component of the citric acid cycle capable of donating electrons to the electron transfer chain.
PMC5618317	D00017	Oxidizing succinate links succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) to the fast-cycling Krebs cycle portion where it participates in the breakdown of acetyl-CoA throughout the whole Krebs cycle.
PMC5618317	D00018	Succinic acid is also involved in ketone body metabolism and butyrate metabolism.
PMC5618317	D00019	Succinic acid is produced in carnitine synthesis, oxidation of branched chain fatty acids, glutamate metabolism, citric acid cycle, arginine and proline metabolism, and valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation.
PMC5618317	D00020	Ascorbic acid is considered an antioxidant and functions as a reducing agent and a coenzyme in several metabolic pathways.
PMC5618317	D00021	The biologically active form of ascorbic acid is vitamin C which cannot be produced in the human body and must be obtained in food.
PMC5618317	D00022	Ascorbic acid is an electron donor for enzymes involved in collagen hydroxylation, biosynthesis of carnitine and norepinephrine, tyrosine metabolism, and the amidation of peptide hormones.
PMC5618317	M02000	A targeted LC-MS/MS method was developed to quantify three key metabolites (succinic acid, ascorbic acid, and carnitine identified from the previous NMR studies) in urine samples using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) on an Agilent 1290 UHPLC/AB Sciex 4000 Qtrap system.
PMC5618317	M03000	Succinic acid (BioXtra, ≥99.0%), L-Ascorbic acid (BioXtra, ≥99.0%, crystalline), and L-Carnitine (synthetic, ≥98%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Oakville, ON, Canada).
PMC5618317	M03001	Succinic acid (D4, 98%), L-Ascorbic acid (1-_13 C, 99%), and L-Carnitine (Trimethyl-D9, 98%) were purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories (Tewksbury, MA, USA).
PMC5618317	M03004	Calibrant solutions (Cal1-Cal8) at concentrations of 5 µM, 10 µM, 100 µM, 200 µM, 400 µM, 600 µM, 800 µM, and 1000 µM were prepared by mixing the stock solutions of unlabeled succinic acid, ascorbic acid, and carnitine in water.
PMC5618317	M03005	An internal standard solution (ISTD) with 100 µM of succinic acid-D4, 200 µM of ascorbic acid-_13 C, and 100 µM of Carnitine-D9 was prepared by mixing the stock solutions of isotopic labeled internal standards in MS grade water.
PMC5618317	M04008	The mixture was extracted with 200 µL of extraction solvent (water with 10 mM ammonium formate, pH3) and filtered through a 0.45 µm member filter before LC-MS injection.
PMC5618317	M05001	An isocratic LC separation of the targeted metabolites (succinic acid, ascorbic acid, and carnitine) was performed using a Waters ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm × 150 mm, 1.7 µm) with 95:5 water:acetonitrile (10 mM Ammonium formate, pH3) as mobile phase and a flowrate of 0.3 mL/min.
PMC5618317	R01012	The three key metabolites that had a p -value less than 0.05 were: succinic acid, ascorbic acid, and carnitine.
PMC5618317	R02001	MS parameter optimization was performed on an AB Sciex 4000 Qtrap for each metabolite using a standard solution of 5 µM of the compound in a 1:1 water:acetonitrile buffer with 0.1% formic acid.
PMC5618317	R02004	Succinic acid and ascorbic acid were monitored in the negative mode, while carnitine was monitored in the positive mode.
PMC5618317	R02005	MRM pair 1 (e.g., succinic acid 1) was used for quantification analysis, MRM pair 2 (e.g., succinic acid 2) was monitored for identification.
PMC5618317	R02007	Succinic acid and ascorbic acid are clearly baseline separated.
PMC5618317	R02023	The concentrations of succinic acid, ascorbic acid, and carnitine were consistent across the 9 plates within acceptable ranges.

PMC5618317	R04004	The regression line equation for carnitine is y = 1.73 + 0.99x; 95% CI for intercept 0.77 to 2.50 and a slope of 0.96 to 1.02 indicated by the small constant and no proportional difference.
PMC5618317	R04005	The regression line equation for succinic acid is y = 4.17 + 1.32x; 95% CI for intercept 2.72 to 5.33 and a slope of 1.26 to 1.38, indicated by the small constant and small proportional difference.
PMC5626581	A02001	Following validation, three top metabolites (xanthine, hypoxanthine and D-mannose) were validated showing lower levels of xanthine and hypoxanthine and higher level of D-mannose in PLP and CRC cases compared to controls.
PMC5626581	A02002	Further exploratory analysis of metabolic pathways revealed key roles for urea cycle and caffeine metabolism associated with PLP and CRC risks.
PMC5626581	A02004	Analysis of hypoxanthine to xanthine levels as ratio indicated association with CRC progression.
PMC5626581	A04000	metabolomic profiling, xanthine/hypoxanthine ratio, D-mannose, adenoma polyps, colorectal cancer
PMC5626581	D00003	Our findings showed that 50 metabolites were significantly altered in PLP and CRC patients in the discovery phase using metabolomic profiling, which were mapped to eight superpathways (nucleotide, carbohydrate, peptide, amino acid, lipid, energy, carnitine metabolism, and xenobiotics) and thirty-one subpathways associated with metabolism.
PMC5626581	D00005	Specifically, we found significantly altered expression of xanthine, hypoxanthine and D-Mannose in both discovery and validation sets.
PMC5626581	D00009	Notably, we observed two metabolites of the purine metabolism pathway, xanthine and hypoxanthine, being associated with PLP and CRC risk.
PMC5626581	D00010	Xanthine is a metabolite intermediate in the degradation of adenosine monophosphate to uric acid, whereas hypoxanthine is oxidized to xanthine by xanthine oxidase (XO), a form of xanthine oxidoreductase.
PMC5626581	D00011	XO is the last catalyzing enzyme of purine metabolism, so it plays critical role in nucleic acid degradation.
PMC5626581	D00012	Cancer and polyps are often accompanied by low expression levels of xanthine and hypoxanthine likely due to increased DNA synthesis (adenine utilization) in the hyper-proliferative tissues.
PMC5626581	D00013	Xanthine can be produced by all human cells, as well as specific plants and animals.
PMC5626581	D00014	Interestingly, caffeine is one of several types of xanthine derivatives and may affect circulating xanthine level.
PMC5626581	D00015	Indeed, pathway analysis of metabolites indicated compounds of caffeine metabolism altered significantly from controls to PLP and CRC.
PMC5626581	D00016	Some studies reported that caffeine inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation and reduced colorectal cancer risk_, .
PMC5626581	D00017	Decreased hypoxanthine level was detected in the urine of patients with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the same trend of reduced level was observed in gastric cancer patients compared to normal individuals.
PMC5626581	D00018	Hypoxanthine level showed reduction in the serum of advanced rectal cancer patients when it was compared between different stages of tumor progression, which is consistent with our findings.
PMC5626581	D00019	Lower levels of xanthine were identified in glioblastoma cases compared to controls in a study by Benny Björkblom, et al .
PMC5626581	D00020	As the termination product of xanthine and hypoxanthine degradation, the level of uric acid is affected by xanthine and hypoxanthine levels.
PMC5626581	D00021	Findings from previous studies have raised the viewpoint that uric acid might contribute to cancer risk, recurrence and mortality, thus pointing to the importance of this metabolic pathway in influencing neoplastic development and outcome.
PMC5626581	D00022	We also analyzed a novel measure, the ratio of hypoxanthine/xanthine levels.
PMC5626581	D00023	This is the first study to report the association of hypoxanthine/xanthine ratio with PLP and CRC risk.
PMC5626581	D00024	Converted from hypoxanthine, xanthine level is dependent on the activity of hypoxanthine metabolism.
PMC5626581	D00025	Thus, hypoxanthine/xanthine ratio demonstrates the relative metabolic rate of hypoxanthine and xanthine degradation.
PMC5626581	D00026	It is shown in our study that low ratio was associated with increased risk, which suggested that PLP and CRC patients have higher hypoxanthine turnover likely due to elevated XO activity.
PMC5626581	D00029	In contrast to the decrease of xanthine and hypoxanthine levels associated with increased PLP and CRC risks, low D-Mannose level was protective in our study.
PMC5626581	D00030	An early literature reported that high mannose oligosaccharides were more prevalent on tumor cells surface compared to normal cells.
PMC5626581	D00031	Mannose, an intermediate metabolite of galactose metabolism pathway, plays an essential role in N-linked glycosylation, which modified certain proteins at the post-translational step.
PMC5626581	D00032	It was reported that high mannose glycans were increased in breast cancer progression and glycans took part in dominant cancer progression phases, such as cancer cell proliferative signaling, activating invasion and metastasis, and tumor promoting inflammation.
PMC5626581	D00033	Our previous study observed that D-Mannose was elevated in late stage esophageal cancer patients, consistent with the finding of higher levels of D-Mannose in PLP and CRC cases compared to controls.
PMC5626581	D00036	We observed that in ever smokers the risk of PLP and CRC significantly increased about two to three fold in subjects with low xanthine or hypoxanthine level or high D-mannose level compared to never smokers.
PMC5626581	D00037	Similar joint effect is seen with high BMI modifying the risk of PLP in subjects with low xanthine or hypoxanthine level or high D-mannose level compared to low BMI individuals.
PMC5626581	D00038	It is notable that for the BMI analysis there was significant interaction with D-mannose in modifying CRC risk.
PMC5626581	D00043	It should be cautioned that circulating level of hypoxanthine has been found to correlate with increased blood sample storage time at room temperature.
PMC5626581	D00051	We determined that the analysis of circulating xanthine, hypoxanthine and D-Mannose levels has the potential to distinguish patients with PLP and CRC from those without cancer.
PMC5626581	D00052	The hypoxanthine/xanthine ratio, which showed plausible biological and clinical significance, may provide a new assessment tool to gauge clinical risk of CRC progression.
PMC5626581	M03006	We modeled the association between xanthine, hypoxanthine and D-Mannose with CRC progression risk by conducting logistic regression models.
PMC5626581	R01008	Further analysis indicated the differential metabolites were mapped to five superpathways that characterized homeostasis metabolism activity in protein biosynthesis, purine metabolism and energy.
PMC5626581	R01009	Notably, the result pointed to urea cycle and caffeine metabolism as the main differential pathways in colorectal cancer progression.
PMC5626581	R02001	Of the sixty-five promising biomarkers, we chose top three metabolites, xanthine, hypoxanthine and D-mannose for further validation, according to their statistical significance as well as scientific impact from previous literature, by performing standard LC/MS-MS assays.
PMC5626581	R02005	In the validation phase, levels of xanthine and hypoxanthine in CRC and PLP were lower than controls, while D-mannose of CRC and PLP groups displayed higher levels than controls (P <0.01), consistent with discovery set.
PMC5626581	R02008	Box plots displayed the median levels of xanthine, hypoxanthine and D-mannose according to colorectal cancer (CRC), adenoma polyp (PLP), and control (CTRL) groups in both discovery and validation phases.
PMC5626581	R03000	The differential levels of xanthine, hypoxanthine, and D-mannose prompted us to examine the association of these metabolites with PLP and CRC risks.
PMC5626581	R03002	As shown in , lower level of xanthine and hypoxanthine were associated with higher risks of PLP and CRC in both discovery and validation sets (OR ranges from 1.8 to 38.8).
PMC5626581	R03003	In contrast, higher level of D-Mannose was associated with increased risks of PLP and CRC (OR ranges from 8 to 16).
PMC5626581	R04002	The results indicated that in ever smokers low level of xanthine and low level of hypoxanthine showed joint effect with smoking on PLP risk (OR=12.46; 95% CI, 2.04-75.95, P <0.01 and OR=7.27; 95% CI, 1.57-33.68, P =0.01 respectively)().
PMC5626581	R04003	Similarly, low level of xanthine or hypoxanthine displayed joint effect with smoking in modifying the risk of CRC (OR=29.23; 95% CI, 3.94-217.01, P <0.01 and OR=14.20; 95% CI, 1.39-84.26, P <0.01, respectively).
PMC5626581	R04004	We also found that overweight/obese subjects (BMI≥25) with low level of xanthine or hypoxanthine had elevated PLP risk (OR=19.1; 95% CI, 1.98-185, P <0.05 and OR=10.1; 95% CI, 1.78-57.5, P <0.01, respectively)().
PMC5626581	R04005	High levels of D-Mannose showed joint effects with smoking on CRC risk (OR=27.91; 95% CI, 2.98-261.33, P <0.01)().
PMC5626581	R04006	Notably, there was significant interaction between BMI and D-mannose level in modifying CRC risk (P interaction <0.001)().
PMC5626581	R05000	Hypoxanthine and xanthine are metabolites found in the same biological pathway involving purine metabolism, and low levels of these metabolites increased the risk of PLP and CRC.
PMC5626581	R05001	To evaluate the potential effect of both metabolites on susceptibility to PLP and CRC, we combined two markers by analyzing the association of hypoxanthine/xanthine ratio (purine metabolite ratio) with PLP and CRC risk via the unconditional multivariate logistic regression analysis method.
PMC5626581	R05002	demonstrated the association of purine metabolite ratio with the risks of PLP, CRC, and CRC progression.
PMC5626581	R05004	Low purine metabolite ratio was associated with increased PLP risk (OR=22.08; 95% CI, 4.18-116.41, P <0.001).
PMC5626581	R05006	We also explored the joint effect of smoking, BMI and purine metabolite ratio on PLP and CRC risk in the validation set (table not shown).
PMC5626581	R05010	Bar chart displayed high hypoxanthine/xanthine ratio was associated with 22.1-fold, 15.4-fold, and 13.7-fold increased risk of PLP, CRC, and CRC progression, respectively, compared to controls.
PMC5684259	A00003	We found increased concentrations of bile acid precursors in CSF from each of the disease states and that patients with inflammatory CNS disease classified as suspected autoimmune disease or of unknown aetiology also showed elevated concentrations of 25-hydroxycholestertol (25-HC,
PMC5684259	A00005	Cholesterol concentrations in CSF were not changed except for patients diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (P  < 0.01) or pathogen-based infections of the CNS (P  < 0.05) where they were elevated.
PMC5684259	A00006	In plasma, we found that 25-HC (P  < 0.01), (25R)26-hydroxycholesterol ((25R)26-HC, P  < 0.05) and 7α-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-enoic acid (7αH,3O-CA, P  < 0.05) were reduced in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients compared to controls.
PMC5684259	A00007	The pattern of reduced plasma levels of 25-HC, (25R)26-HC and 7αH,3O-CA was unique to RRMS.
PMC5684259	A00010	In CSF, we find that the dominating metabolites reflect the acidic pathway of bile acid biosynthesis and the elevated levels of these in CNS disease is likely to reflect cholesterol release as a result of demyelination or neuronal death.
PMC5684259	A00011	25-HC is elevated in patients with inflammatory CNS disease probably as a consequence of up-regulation of the type 1 interferon-stimulated gene cholesterol 25-hydroxylase in macrophages.
PMC5684259	A02000	Sterol, Oxysterol, Bile acid, CNS, Inflammation, HPLC, MS
PMC5684259	D00000	In the current study, we have measured the levels of non-esterified sterols, oxysterols, 25-D_3 and of cholestenoic and cholenoic acids in plasma and CSF of patients with MS, neurodegenerative and inflammatory CNS disease.
PMC5684259	D00005	Non-esterified oxysterols are present in CSF at pg/mL levels, and in control subjects 25-HC is at our limit of quantification (0.03 ng/mL) and was not found to change in any of the patient groups except those with SA/UA where the level increased to 0.06 ±
PMC5684259	D00009	which shows that in mouse macrophages 25-HC is a mediator of negative feedback towards interleukin 1 (IL-1) family cytokine production and inflammasome activity, through binding to INSIG (insulin-induced gene) and antagonising the sterol response element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) driven mevalonate pathway, thereby, reducing Il1b transcription and repressing IL-1-activating inflammasomes.
PMC5684259	D00012	Ch25h- deficient macrophages produce more proinflammatory IL-17A_+ T cells following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation and cytokines that cooperate with transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) to induce T_h 17 cells include IL-1β.
PMC5684259	D00013	Notably, after LPS stimulation Ch25h -deficient macrophages overproduce Il1b .
PMC5684259	D00015	Reboldi et al. suggested that this may be through reducing the cellular content of sterols generated via the mevalonate pathway.
PMC5684259	D00019	Although (25R)26-HC and 7αH,3O-CA were, like 25-HC, also found to be reduced (P  < 0.05) in RRMS plasma (Fig. ), the latter is not known to bind to INSIG, while neither sterol is formed by IFN-activated macrophages to any significant extent.
PMC5684259	D00027	In summary, a reduced capacity of macrophages to generated 25-HC may result in enhanced activity of the mevalonate pathway leading to over production of Il1b , and to reduced LXR activation which will both lead to enhanced inflammatory activity of macrophages recruited to the CNS in MS.
PMC5684259	D01000	In contrast to plasma, there is a significant elevation in (25R)26-HC (P  < 0.05) and of its metabolites 3β-HCA (P  < 0.05) and 7αH,3O-CA (P  < 0.01) in CSF of RRMS patients (Fig. ).
PMC5684259	D01001	These cholesterol metabolites represent early members of the “acidic pathway” of bile acid biosynthesis which is known to be operative in the CNS [, ].
PMC5684259	D01002	A latter member of this pathway, 7α-hydroxy-3,24-bis oxocholest-4-enoic acid (7αH,3,24-diO-CA), formed in the peroxisome as a thioester is also found to be elevated in RRMS CSF (Fig. ).
PMC5684259	D01003	MS is a demyelinating disease with the consequent release of non-esterified cholesterol in the CNS.
PMC5684259	D01004	Cholesterol is metabolised in the CNS in astrocytes through cytochrome P450 (CYP) 27A1 catalysed oxidation to (25R)26-HC and subsequently to 3β-HCA and then on to 3β,7α-diHCA and 7αH,3O-CA by the consecutive action of CYP7B1 and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) 3B7 enzymes (Fig. ).
PMC5684259	D01005	An increase in the availability in CNS of non-esterified cholesterol, the primary CYP27A1 substrate, is the likely explanation for the elevated activity of this pathway.
PMC5684259	D01006	Patients with CIS, which is MS resulting from a single episode of demyelination in one area of the CNS, also show an increase in the CYP27A1 product 3β-HCA (P  < 0.05) but not its downstream metabolites.
PMC5684259	D01007	Interestingly, both 3β-HCA and 3β,7β-diHCA have been shown to be neurotoxic.
PMC5684259	D01009	The cholesterol metabolites 3β-HCA (P  < 0.05) and 7αH,3O–CA (P  < 0.01) of the “acidic pathway” are elevated in the AD and PD group, while in the ALS group 7α,(25R)26-diHCO
PMC5684259	D01011	There are very few other studies of cholestenoic acids in CSF; however, Saeed et al.
PMC5684259	D01012	found that levels of 7αH,3O-CA were similar in AD patients and controls.
PMC5684259	D01013	Brown et al. have found that CYP27A1 expression increases in oligodendrocytes in AD; this may provide an additional route to 3β-HCA from cholesterol released by dying neurons in this disease.
PMC5684259	D01016	Notably, the metabolite of 25-HC, 7α,25-diHCO is also elevated in CSF of these patients (P  < 0.05) as are (25R)26-HC (P  < 0.05),
PMC5684259	D01017	7α,(25R)26-diHC (P  = 0.05) and 7α,(25R)26
PMC5684259	D01020	When plasma was analysed from these patients, none of the metabolites showed statistical differences compared to controls except 7α,(25R)26-diHCO, which unlike the situation in CSF was reduced in concentration in plasma (P  < 0.05).
PMC5684259	D01022	However, the drive for an increased flux through the “acidic pathway” may be a consequence of increased availability of non-esterified cholesterol.
PMC5684259	D01023	In fact, the absence of a change in non-esterified cholesterol levels in CSF in all disease groups, except those with PBI or ALS, highlights its tight regulation in CNS.
PMC5684259	D01024	The increased CSF concentrations of metabolites of the “acidic pathway” of bile acid biosynthesis indicate that this pathway represents a salvage route for removal of excess cholesterol in CNS disease which may be defective or overstretched in ALS and PBI.
PMC5684259	D02003	As might be expected (25R)26-HC is highly correlated with 7α,(25R)26-diHC and 3β-HCA corresponding to the first metabolites of the two branches of the “acidic pathway” of bile acid biosynthesis (Fig. ).
PMC5684259	D02004	(25R)26-HC also correlates with 7α,(25R)26-diHCO the downstream metabolite of 7α,(25R)26-diHC and with 3β,7α-diHCA and 3β,7β-diHCA, downstream metabolites of 3β-HCA, but to a lesser extent.
PMC5684259	D02005	Concentrations of (25R)26-HC also correlate with 24S-HC, presumably as both have cholesterol as their precursor.
PMC5684259	D02006	Both 24S-HC and (25R)26-HC correlate strongly with cholesterol.
PMC5684259	D02008	7α,(25R)26-diHC correlates strongly with its downstream metabolite 3β,7α-diHCA, while 7α,(25R)26-diHCO correlates most strongly with 7α,25-diHCO, both products of HSD3B7 metabolism.
PMC5684259	D02009	3β-HCA correlates very strongly with 3β,7β-diHCA and less strongly with 7αH,3O-CA and 3β,7α-diHCA.
PMC5684259	D02010	3β,7α-diHCA correlates most strongly with 7α,(25R)26-diHC and 3β,7β-diHCA.
PMC5684259	D02011	This data suggest that the 7α,(25R)26-diHC branch provides the primary route to 3β,7α-diHCA in CNS.
PMC5684259	D02012	7αH,3O-CA correlates with 7αH,3,24-diO-CA and the ultimate metabolite found in CSF, 7α-hydroxy-3-oxochol-4-enoic acid (7αH,3O-Δ_4 -BA).
PMC5684259	D02013	A fascinating feature of the pair-wise correlations is the tight cluster indicated by the “red box” incorporating 7αH,3O-CA, two dihydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-enoic acid isomers (7α,x-diH,3O-CA and 7α,y-diH,3O–CA) and 7αH,3,24-diO-CA.
PMC5684259	D02014	We do not have an authentic standard for the latter compound whose identification is based on exact mass, retention time and multistage fragmentation (MS _n ) spectrum and the location of the hydroxy groups on the two dihydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-enoic acid isomers is unclear.
PMC5684259	D02017	The absence of correlations with 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7α-HC) confirms that the “neutral pathway” of bile acid biosynthesis is not operative in the CNS.
PMC5684259	D02019	The correlations between specific oxysterols and individual samples, including the inflammatory CNS disease group, are shown in the Fig. in Online Resource 10.
PMC5684259	D02020	As is evident from the dendrogram, the five acids 7αH,3O-Δ_4 -BA, 7αH,3,24-diO-CA; 7αH,3O-CA; 7α,x-diH,3O-CA; and 7α,y-diH,3O-CA cluster together, as do 3β-HCA, (25R)26-HC, 3β,7β-diHCA, 3β,7α-diHCA and 7α,(25R)26-diHC.
PMC5684259	D02022	The dendrogram groups together 7O–C, 6-hydroxycholeserol (6-HC) and 7α-HC, these are all potential autoxidation products (see Online Resource 3).
PMC5684259	D02029	While the metabolite correlations in CSF are dominated by the “acidic pathway” of bile acid biosynthesis, the correlations in plasma are reflective of both the “acidic pathway” and of the “neutral pathway” starting with 7α-HC followed by 7α-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one (7α-HCO, Fig. ) which are strongly correlated (Online Resource 11, see Online Resource 7 for P values for the significance of correlation).
PMC5684259	D02030	As expected from the pathway outlined in Fig. , 7α-HCO correlates with 7α,(25R)26-diHCO, 7αH,3OCA and 7αH,3O-Δ_4 -BA, while (25R)26-HC correlates with 3β-HCA and 7αH,3O-CA.
PMC5684259	D02031	Unsurprisingly, 3β-HCA correlates strongly with 3β,7α-diHCA, while 7αH,3O-CA correlates strongly with 7αH,3O-Δ_4 -BA.
PMC5684259	D02033	in Online Resources 12, 25-HC clusters most strongly with 24S-HC and both cluster with their precursor cholesterol,
PMC5684259	D02034	while 7α,25-diHC and 7α,(25R)26-diHC cluster together as do their HSD3B7 products 7α,25-diHCO and 7α,(25R)26-diHCO
PMC5684259	D02036	7α,25-diHC and 7α,(25R)26-diHC share CYP7B1 as the ultimate enzyme in their biosynthesis.
PMC5684259	D02041	In CSF, we find that the dominating cholesterol metabolites reflect the “acidic pathway” of bile acid biosynthesis and the elevated levels of these metabolites in CNS disease is likely to reflect cholesterol release as a result of demyelination or neuron death.

PMC5686116	A00000	Routine laboratory lipid assays include simple measurements of total cholesterol, triacylglycerols and HDL.
PMC5686116	A00004	The hereby presented findings imply that _1 H NMR is suitable for rapid, simple and non-invasive detection of lipids from 30 structural groups, among them triacylglycerols, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, sphingomyelin, total phospholipids, total, free and esterified cholesterol, total and unsaturated fatty acids.
PMC5686116	D00005	High accuracy of our method was confirmed by strong positive correlations between NMR signal intensity for 2 groups representing total cholesterol/3 groups representing triacylglycerols and serum concentrations of these metabolites determined using routine enzymatic methods.
PMC5686116	D00006	Postoperative changes in cholesterol and triacylglycerol contents were more evident when estimated on the basis of NMR spectra (see: Tables  and ).
PMC5686116	D00009	However, our present study showed that despite these potential limitations, NMR is suitable for rapid lipidomic analysis of whole groups of polar lipids: PC, PE, SM and total PL.
PMC5686116	D00017	Moreover it allows to measure some additional serum lipids – PE as well as lathosterol, which can serve as a marker of cholesterol production rate in human organism.
PMC5686116	D01002	The most evident decrease (by 82.5%) was observed in the case of 7-lathosterol, a precursor of cholesterol.
PMC5686116	D01003	7-lathosterol is a marker of cholesterol production rate, and therefore, our findings suggest that bariatric surgery results in a substantial decrease in cholesterol synthesis.
PMC5686116	D01004	This observation is consistent with the results published recently by Vuono et al ., who using GC-MS, also demonstrated a significant decrease in serum lathosterol level in patients after sleeve gastrectomy.
PMC5686116	D01005	The same study revealed that lower level of serum lathosterol was associated with a decrease in cholesterol synthesis.
PMC5686116	D01006	After bariatric surgery, the levels of total, esterified and free cholesterol in our patients were approximately 45% lower than prior to the procedure.
PMC5686116	D01007	However, even more pronounced (57%) postoperative reduction was observed in the case of triacylglycerol content.
PMC5686116	D01008	Noticeably, also the analysis with routine enzymatic methods demonstrated that the postoperative decrease in TG was greater than the reduction of total cholesterol level (Table ).
PMC5686116	D01009	The key deliverable of our study is the development of a method for rapid detection of quantitative changes in many groups of polar lipids, including PC, PE, SM and total PL, as well as UFA in sera from morbidly obese patients after bariatric surgeries.
PMC5686116	D01010	UFA are the major component of PL.
PMC5686116	D01011	The intensities of UFA and PL signals after bariatric surgery were shown to correlate strongly (R = 0.95;
PMC5686116	D01012	p < 0.01), which implies that the postoperative decrease in PL might result from a lesser availability of UFA.
PMC5686116	D01015	Therefore, the postoperative decrease in UFA and PL may contribute to attenuation of oxidative stress, a phenomenon observed after bariatric surgeries.
PMC5686116	D01016	Aside from the role in oxidative stress propagation, PL composition and content may also influence the risk of diabetes mellitus.
PMC5686116	D01018	Although polar lipids seem to be vital for health of obese subjects, only few previous studies addressed bariatric surgery-related changes in serum phospholipids.
PMC5686116	D01019	Kayser et al . used HPLC-MS/MS to document a decrease in various species of PC, PE and PG at 3 months after gastric bypass procedure.
PMC5686116	D01020	Also in that study, a decrease in the level of SFA-containing species of SM co-existed with an increase in the content of PUFA-containing SM.
PMC5686116	D01021	A decrease in PC, PE and SM was also reported by Graessler et al .
PMC5686116	D01024	However, in contrast to the MS-based technique, our method is suitable for rapid, non-destructive analysis of a sample; thus, it provides an information about the changes in overall PC, PE and SM contents in the sample, which can be then re-used for more accurate MS analyses, if necessary.
PMC5686116	D01025	Contrary to our hereby presented findings, Lopes et al . reported an increase in PC at 12 months after RYGB.
PMC5686116	D01026	Perhaps, PC content increases with time elapsed since the bariatric procedure, due to a raise in HDL concentration.
PMC5686116	D01028	50% postoperative decrease in the levels of total and unsaturated fatty acids, as well as a decrease in the contents of two specific fatty acids, oleic and linoleic.
PMC5686116	D01031	FFA constitute only a small proportion of all FA building other serum lipids, including PL and TG.
PMC5686116	D01032	Oleic acid is synthetized primarily in the liver, by stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1).
PMC5686116	D01034	On the other hand, linoleic acid is an essential fatty acid and thus, its decreased content after bariatric surgery was likely associated with a reduced food intake.
PMC5686116	D01035	In conclusion, this study showed that extraction of serum lipids, followed by NMR analysis, lasting no longer than a few minutes, are suitable for rapid detection of various serum lipids, including total TG, PC, PE, SM, total PL, total, free and esterified cholesterol, total and unsaturated fatty acids, as well as 7-lathosterol, oleic acid, and linoleic acid, in obese patients prior to and after bariatric surgeries.
PMC5686116	D01036	A postoperative decrease in serum levels of various lipids likely reflected their reduced dietary intake, as well as lower rate of cholesterol production, and less intense liver synthesis and desaturation of fatty acids in obese patients subjected to bariatric surgeries.
PMC5686116	D01037	However, a concomitant decrease of some other lipid species being important for patient health, such as PUFA and PL, points to a necessity of their dietary supplementation in patients after bariatric surgery, in order to prevent deficiencies.
PMC5686116	M01002	Prior to lipidomic analysis, serum analytes were dissolved in 600 µl of deuterated chloroform and deuterated methanol mixture (2:1; v/v) with 3 mM TMS.

PMC5686116	R02000	As shown in Table , bariatric surgery contributed to a significant decrease in the levels of all analyzed lipids, by 57% for triacylglycerols, by 40–45% for SM, PC, PE and by 42% for total PL.
PMC5686116	R02001	The levels of total, free and esterified cholesterol decreased by 43–48%, and the levels of total fatty acids and specific fatty acids, including UFA, 18:1, 18:2, 20:4 and 22:6, by about 50%.
PMC5686116	R02002	The most evident decrease (by about 80%) was observed in the case of C_18 H_3 group in total 7-lathosterol (Table ).

PMC5693892	A00008	In particular, these 4 OTUs were significantly higher in patients with higher Child-Pugh scores, who also showed diminished phenylalanine and tryptophan metabolisms in the inferred gut metagenomic functions.
PMC5693892	D00009	At the inferred metagenomic pathway level, 2 KEGG orthologues enriched in CHB patients belong to Membrane Transport, while 10 KEGG orthologues enriched in healthy controls belong to Carbohydrate Metabolism and Amino Acid Metabolism, which is consistent with Qin et al.
PMC5693892	D00029	In liver disease, the accumulation of phenylalanine and tyrosine in the plasma is not associated with impaired catabolism, but only with increased uptake and production of such essential amino acids (Heberer et al., ;
PMC5693892	D00031	In this study, we observed that 10 OTUs, particularly OTU38 (Streptococcus ), OTU124 (Veillonella ), OTU224 (Streptococcus ), and OTU55 (Haemophilus ), were positively associated with the serum levels of L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine, and the abundances of these OTUs were significantly increased in the Child-Pugh phase B group.
PMC5693892	M00003	The CHB patients were diagnosed based on increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (above the upper limit of the normal range, 0–40 U/L) in at least two blood samples assayed over a 6-month period and the presence of detectable hepatitis B surface antigen and/or HBV DNA.
PMC5693892	M02000	Serum levels of total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), indirect bilirubin (IDBIL), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and albumin (ALB) were measured by an automatic biochemical analyzer (Model LX-20; Beckman, Fullerton, USA).
PMC5693892	M09001	Each 100-μL serum sample was combined with 10 μL of heptadecanoic acid (1 mg/mL) and 300 μL of solvent (methanol: chloroform, 3:1, V/V).
PMC5693892	M09004	By adding 80 μL of methoxyamine in pyridine (15 mg/mL) to the GC vial and vortex-mixing for 30 s, the methoximation reaction was carried out for 90 min under rocking in a shaker at 30°C.

PMC5693892	R05016	Particularly, four OTUs, OTU38 (Streptococcus ), OTU124 (Veillonella ), OTU224 (Streptococcus ) and OTU55 (Haemophilus ), were closely associated with both the clinical indices and the accumulation of 10 serum metabolites, especially L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine, which are AAAs that play a pathogenic role in liver disease (Morgan et al., ;
PMC5719006	A00003	The method was validated following stringent FDA requirements and applied to 194 samples from a subgroup of newborns with HIE (N = 61) enrolled in a multicenter clinical trial (HYPOTOP) for the determination of lactate, pyruvate, ketone bodies and several Krebs cycle metabolites at different sampling time points.
PMC5719006	A00004	The analysis of plasma samples from newborns with HIE revealed a decrease of lactate, pyruvate and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations, whereas rising malate concentrations were observed.
PMC5719006	A00005	In healthy control newborns (N = 19) significantly lower levels of pyruvate and lactate were found in comparison to age-matched newborns with HIE undergoing TH, whereas acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate levels were clearly increased.
PMC5719006	D00005	This work aimed at shedding light into the evolution of several key metabolites related to energy metabolism, including lactate, together with pyruvate, the ketone bodies acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate as well as several Krebs cycle intermediates, in newborns with HIE receiving TH during the first 72 hours of life (see Fig.
PMC5719006	D00013	The validation study proved that the achieved levels of accuracy and precision were adequate for the simultaneous quantification of the set of metabolites in a sample volume of 50 µL. Concerns about stability of ketone bodies and lactate in plasma samples have been raised and some authors propose the use of stabilizing agents for storage.
PMC5719006	D00016	Under aerobic conditions glucose is metabolized through the glycolytic pathway and penetrates in the mitochondria where pyruvate is converted to acetyl coenzyme A, enters the tricarboxylic acid cycle and couples to the respiratory chain yielding energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate through oxidative phosphorylation.
PMC5719006	D00017	In capillary blood drawn on day 4 from healthy full-term newborns, lactate and pyruvate were reported to range between 367 and 3245 and 10 and 141 μmol L_−1 , respectively.
PMC5719006	D00018	In this study, for healthy term newborns at two days of age ranges (percentile 10 to 90) between 300 and 1000 and 6 and 50 μmol L_−1 (see Table ) were obtained for lactate and pyruvate, respectively.
PMC5719006	D00019	During hypoxia-ischemia decreased cerebral perfusion reduces the delivery of oxygen and glucose to the brain.
PMC5719006	D00020	Oxidative phosphorylation is blocked and pyruvate is converted into L-lactate through the anaerobic metabolism.
PMC5719006	D00022	Initial lactate levels are a useful biochemical marker to assess the degree of birth asphyxia.
PMC5719006	D00023	It has been demonstrated that lactate levels took longer to normalize in asphyxiated newborns with moderate to severe neonatal encephalopathy compared with newborns with mild neonatal encephalopathy.
PMC5719006	D00024	In a retrospective case series Balushi et al . suggest that lactate levels during the first 4 days of life should be carefully monitored in asphyxiated term newborns treated with hypothermia in order to optimize handling of those patients and alleviate brain injury.
PMC5719006	D00025	Furthermore, during hypothermia peripheral perfusion is significantly decreased and lactate production may indicate hypoxia at tissue level even in the absence of metabolic acidosis.
PMC5719006	D00026	This study for the first time reports ranges and evolution of lactate values in newborns with HIE during TH.
PMC5719006	D00027	This knowledge is important for the interpretation of lactate values of babies during TH monitored in the neonatal intensive care unit.
PMC5719006	D00028	In the cohort studied in this clinical trial an increase in lactate levels was found in the acute stage and a decreasing tendency with time was observed as expected, revealing a partial restoring of aerobic metabolism upon clinical stabilization as a consequence of the energy saving mechanisms triggered by TH.
PMC5719006	D00029	Pyruvate showed increased levels during the whole examined time period and concentrations also decreased with time although remaining elevated as compared to the control group at 48 h of life (see Fig.
PMC5719006	D00031	In rat brain tissue, the activation of the anaerobic flux during hypoxia-ischemia and increased glycolysis has been reported with all rate-limiting enzymes activated, being the transport of glucose across the blood-brain barrier the major rate-limiting step of this process.
PMC5719006	D00032	Consequently, the authors found increased pyruvate and lactate levels in brain during hypoxia-ischemia.
PMC5719006	D00033	Here, reported results corroborate the accumulation of pyruvate during hypoxia-ischemia and show the evolution of its concentration profile during TH.
PMC5719006	D00034	Whereas in adults glucose is essentially the sole energy fuel for the brain, in neonates the ketone bodies acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate derived from ketogenesis in the liver are likely to be as important.
PMC5719006	D00035	Furthermore ketones have been found to act as neuroprotectors.
PMC5719006	D00036	In neonates suffering from severe HIE depletion of ketones has been reported suggesting that systemic metabolic responses such as ketogenesis may play a key role in preventing neurological injury during asphyxia.
PMC5719006	D00039	A recent study revealed that, hypothermia achieves its neuroprotective effects by mediating the cellular acetylation status through a coordinated suppression of acetyl-CoA, a metabolite that resides in metabolic junctions of glycolysis, amino-acid catabolism and ketosis.
PMC5719006	D00040	Both pyruvate and ketone bodies are major sources for acetyl-CoA, and were found to decrease under hypothermia conditions in rat brain.
PMC5719006	D00041	Succinate accumulation has been associated with severe HIE, possibly evidencing HIF-1α mediated neurological injury.
PMC5719006	D00042	Chouchanie et al . showed that the malate/aspartate shuttle and purine nucleotide cycle pathways increase fumarate production, which is then converted to succinate by succinate dehydrogenase reversal.
PMC5719006	D00043	The selective accumulation of succinate has been described as a universal metabolic signature of ischemia in a range of mouse and rat tissues and is thought to be responsible for mitochondrial ROS production that initiate ischemia-reperfusion injury.
PMC5719006	D00045	Determined levels of succinate, fumarate, malate, and α-ketoglutarate did not show statistically significant alterations in comparison to normal control babies.
PMC5719006	D00046	Malate showed an increasing tendency with time, although levels found at 48 h were not different from those found in the control group.
PMC5719006	D00047	The HYPOTOP trial aimed at the assessment of the neuroprotective effects of the administration of TPM as compared to a placebo.
PMC5719006	D00048	Results presented in this study regarding metabolites involved in central metabolic pathways did not reveal any effect of the administration of TPM on metabolite levels.
PMC5719006	D00049	Ongoing studies will focus on the evaluation of the effect of TPM on other metabolic pathways as well as imaging (MRI) and short-and long-term clinical outcomes of the babies enrolled in the HYPOTOP trial.
PMC5719006	D00057	Altogether these interventions attenuated the rate of ATP consumption and enhanced its synthesis during the secondary energy failure phase (5, 6, 7).

PMC5719006	M02004	Concentrations were ranging between 3.9 and 1000 µmol L_−1 for lactate, 0.4 and 100 µmol L_−1 for pyruvate, acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate and 0.1 and 25 µmol L_−1 for succinate, fumarate, malate and α-ketoglutarate.
PMC5719006	M02005	On each of the three validation days, 500 µL of spiking solution was prepared in H_2 O:CH_3 CN (1:4, v/v) containing 10 mmol L_−1 of lactate, 800 µmol L_−1 of pyruvate, 400 µmol L_−1 of acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate and 80 µmol L_−1 of succinate, fumarate, malate and α-ketoglutarate.
PMC5719006	M03003	200 µL of supernatant or standard solution were transferred to an Eppendorf® tube and 8 and 4 µL of Pyr_13 C and DMBA, both at a concentration of 1 mM were added, respectively.
PMC5719006	M03006	Dry residues were suspended in 20 µL of a freshly prepared 4% (w/w) methoxyamine solution in pyridine.
PMC5719006	M03009	After 30 min of reaction time at 37 °C under agitation, samples and standards were diluted with 40 µL of hexane and placed in capped glass vials for GC-MS analysis.
PMC5719006	M03010	Samples were re-analysed after 1:10 dilution with hexane in case analyte concentrations exceed the established quantification range.
PMC5719006	R01017	However, for acetoacetate, succinate and α-ketoglutarate the use of a second order polynomial fit was necessary in order to cover a sufficiently wide concentration range.
PMC5719006	R01018	With the exception of lactate, signal normalization employing an IS was necessary.
PMC5719006	R01021	It can be observed that in this plasma sample, all studied metabolites were detected with the exception of fumarate.
PMC5719006	R01022	Chromatographic resolution >1 from other unknown matrix compounds was achieved for all metabolites with the exception of malate.
PMC5719006	R01028	Note: for lactate the 1:10 diluted sample is depicted.
PMC5719006	R01032	No significant matrix effect was observed for pyruvate, succinate, malate and α-ketoglutarate.
PMC5719006	R02002	Whereas some metabolites (i.e. acetoacetate, succinate, fumarate and α-ketoglutarate) remained constant throughout the first three days of life, others showed significant changes (two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test for equal medians, α = 0.05, p-value for each metabolite shown in Fig.
PMC5719006	R02004	Accordingly, lactate, pyruvate and β-hydroxybutyrate concentrations decreased, whereas rising malate concentrations were observed.
PMC5719006	R02005	When comparing metabolite concentrations of newborns treated with TPM or placebo stratified by sampling time points, no significant differences were observed at 24 h, 48 h or 72 h after the administration of the first dose (data not shown).
PMC5719006	R02007	Note: acetoacetate, succinate, malate and α-ketoglutarate detected in 77, 95, 92 and 60% and other analytes in 100% of samples, concentrations < LLOQ were set to 1/2xLLOQ; p-values calculated employing the two-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test for equal medians.
PMC5719006	R02009	Main descriptors of the distribution of plasma metabolite concentrations of the control group in comparison to newborns subjected to hypothermia treatment 48 h after the administration of the first dose of TPM are summarized in Table .

PMC5724857	A02000	Serum metabolic profiling identified a series of 12 metabolites with significant alterations, and the related metabolic pathways involved glycerophospholipid, sphingolipid, phospholipid, fat acid, acylcarnitine, heme, and purine metabolism.
PMC5724857	A02001	Subsequently, multiple logistic regression analyses of these metabolites showed uric acid, sphinganine and adrenoyl ethanolamide were potential biomarkers of ischemic stroke with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.941.
PMC5724857	D00001	Multiple logistic regression analysis of these 12 metabolites showed that three of the metabolites identified, uric acid, sphinganine, and adrenoyl ethanolamide, were significant biomarkers of IS.
PMC5724857	D00004	Through the potential target metabolic pathway analysis with MetaboAnalyst 3.0, two metabolic pathways, glycerophospholipid metabolism and sphingolipid metabolism, were found to be associated with IS.
PMC5724857	D00005	Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and LysoPC are the intermediates in glycerophospholipid metabolism.
PMC5724857	D00006	It has been reported previously that glycerophospholipid constitutes the backbone of the neural membrane, which provides a suitable environment, fluidity, and ion permeability.
PMC5724857	D00007	Brain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid, can be released from the degradation of glycerophospholipids.
PMC5724857	D00009	The results suggest that the alteration of glycerophospholipid metabolism could interpret the reason for the cerebral damage from IS.
PMC5724857	D00010	Sphinganine is an intermediate in sphingolipid metabolism.
PMC5724857	D00011	Sphingolipids are a series of cell membrane-derived lipids which act as signaling molecules and play a critical role in cell death and survival, proliferation, recognition, and migration.
PMC5724857	D00012	It has been reported that sphingolipid activities change after stroke and correlate with stroke outcome, and the metabolic pathway of sphingolipid was closely correlated with stroke, which maybe a novel therapeutic target in stroke for reducing stroke-induced brain injury.
PMC5724857	D00014	Abnormal phospholipid metabolism that correlated with lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE) and phosphatidylserine (PS) were observed.
PMC5724857	D00015	Two biomarkers found in phospholipids were correlated with IS.
PMC5724857	D00016	LysoPE is a hydrolysis product of PE by phospholipase A2, which plays a role in cell-mediated cell signaling and activation of other enzymes.
PMC5724857	D00017	PS is a glycerophospholipid in which a phosphorylserine moiety occupies a glycerol substitution site.
PMC5724857	D00018	Previous studies have reported abnormal levels of phospholipid in serum [, ].
PMC5724857	D00019	In addition, recent structural and functional data identify phospholipids (such as PS) as a major bioactive component of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs).
PMC5724857	D00021	In the present study, the significantly decreased LysoPE and PS in the serum of patients with IS suggest an abnormity of phospholipid metabolism in patients with IS, and also maybe one of the potential reasons for IS.
PMC5724857	D00022	Abnormal fatty acid metabolism that correlated with adrenoyl ethanolamide was also observed.
PMC5724857	D00023	Adrenoyl ethanolamide is an N-acylethanolamine (NAE).
PMC5724857	D00024	NAEs are derivatives of fatty acids in which the carboxylic group of the fatty acid is bound by an amide linkage to the amino group of ethanolamine.
PMC5724857	D00026	NAEs are signaling lipids whose synthesis is upregulated in response to ischemia, and serum NAE concentration increased about 30-fold in a rat study after stroke.
PMC5724857	D00027	The increase of adrenoyl ethanolamide in our study may be a self-protective mechanism during cerebral damage caused by IS.
PMC5724857	D00028	We also found abnormal acylcarnitine metabolism.
PMC5724857	D00029	Linoelaidyl carnitine is along-chain acylcarnitine.
PMC5724857	D00030	Makrecka et al . showed that long-chain acylcarnitine could regulate the metabolism of pyruvate–lactate and long-chain fatty acids in the mitochondria, and the increase of long-chain acylcarnitine could impair glucose metabolism.
PMC5724857	D00031	A study by Guasch-Ferré et al . also indicated that the elevated concentrations of acylcarnitines are independently associated with risk of stroke.
PMC5724857	D00032	Therefore, the increase of linoelaidyl carnitine may be one of the causes of high levels of serum glucose in patients with IS in the present study, which also might contribute to the occurrence of IS.
PMC5724857	D00033	Other abnormal metabolic pathways found in the present study were correlated with biomarkers of bilirubin and uric acid.
PMC5724857	D00034	Bilirubin is an end product of heme metabolism and has been reported to have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects properties [, ], and there was an inverse relationship between serum bilirubin and CRP [, ].
PMC5724857	D00035	Moreover, Kimm et al . found that serum bilirubin has a protective function against stroke risk, and a low serum bilirubin level could be an independent predictor of stroke incidence.
PMC5724857	D00036	Therefore, the low level of bilirubin in patients might partly explain the reasons for the high levels of CRP and the occurrence of IS in the study.
PMC5724857	D00037	Uric acid, as a product of purine metabolism, is a powerful endogenous antioxidant which may increase in many oxidative stress situations such as hypertension.
PMC5724857	D00040	In addition, Hozawa et al . found that uric acid is an independent predictor of IS.
PMC5724857	D00041	Uric acid is biologically active and can stimulate oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and vasoconstriction.
PMC5724857	D00042	The level of serum uric acid is closely related to the occurrence of stroke.
PMC5724857	D00043	Increased serum uric acid may increase the risk of thrombosis by promoting lipid peroxidation, the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein, an increase of oxygen free radicals and platelet adhesion, and promote platelet thrombus formation in early thrombosis.
PMC5724857	D00044	Moreover, Uric acid crystallization can deposit in the vessel wall, to injure the endothelium directly, induce inflammation, and promote the formation of atherosclerosis.
PMC5724857	D00045	Atherosclerosis is the most important factor and link in the mechanism of stroke and the determination of serum uric acid levels can be used to speculate the risk of IS [,,].
PMC5724857	D00046	Our study showed higher levels of blood pressure in patients with IS, which may be from high serum uric acid and together they could contribute to the occurrence of IS.
PMC5724857	M01004	Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and high-density/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C/ HDL-C) were determined by commercial kits (Biosino Biotechnology Ltd, Beijing, China).
PMC5724857	M01005	A Kyoto blood sugar test meter and test strip (Arkray, Inc. Kyoto, Japan) were used to determine the level of plasma glucose, and the level of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was determined using an enzyme immunoassay assay kit (Quantikine Human C-Reactive Protein Immunoassay, R&D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA).
PMC5724857	M02000	Chromatography-grade acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from Honeywell, Burdick, & Jackson (Muskegon, MI, USA).
PMC5724857	M02001	Leucine enkephalin and analytical grade formic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St Louis, MO, USA) and Harbin Biotechnology Company (Harbin, China), respectively.
PMC5724857	M03001	After deproteinization with methanol (1:5), the supernatant of serum samples was dried with nitrogen at 37°C, dissolved in acetonitrile and water (3:1) and centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 15 min.
PMC5724857	M03008	The mobile phase consisted of two solutions including solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (acetonitrile), and the flow rate was 0.3 mL/min.
PMC5724857	M03014	For ensuring accuracy and reproducibility, leucine enkephalin in 200 pg/mL was used as the lock-mass for positive ESI mode ([M+H]+ = 556.2771) via a lock spray interface.
PMC5724857	M04001	After deproteinization with methanol (1:5), the supernatant of serum samples was dried with nitrogen at 37°C, dissolved in acetonitrile and water (3:1) and centrifuged at 10 000 × g for 15 min.
PMC5724857	M05002	The mobile phase consisted of two solutions including solvent A (0.1% formic acid in water) and solvent B (acetonitrile), and the flow rate was 0.3 mL/min.
PMC5724857	M05008	For ensuring accuracy and reproducibility, leucine enkephalin in 200 pg/mL was used as the lock-mass for positive ESI mode ([M+H]+ = 556.2771) via a lock spray interface.

PMC5739065	A00004	We report application of this platform to the analysis of human urine from patients with and without type 1 diabetes, where we observed statistically significant variations in the concentration of disaccharides and previously unreported chemical isomers.
PMC5739065	R00002	500 μL of ice-cold acetonitrile was added to 50 μL of each plasma sample, and vigorously mixed for 1 min.
PMC5739065	R00007	A urease pre-treatment procedure was performed before methanol extraction on the urine samples.
PMC5739065	R00010	Methanol extraction was performed by adding 1 mL of ice-cold methanol to the urine solution after urease pre-treatment.
PMC5739065	R00015	A mixed stock solution was then prepared using a 99.9/0.1 acetonitrile/formic acid buffer solution and 10 μM of each chemical for SPE-IMS-MS method optimization.
PMC5739065	R02005	To overload the sample loop, 30 μL of each urine sample was loaded onto the SPE cartridge using a combination of 0.1% formic acid and 99.9% water (v/v) (mobile phase A, flow rate at 1.5 mL/min), and eluted using a combination of 0.1% formic acid, 49.95% isopropanol (IPA) and 49.95% methanol (v/v/v) (mobile phase B, flow rate at 0.6 mL/min).
PMC5739065	R02008	For the graphitic carbon cartridge, the polar urine extracts were loaded using the same mobile phase A as used for C18 cartridge, but the small molecules were eluted using a combination of 0.1% formic acid, 25% acetonitrile, 25% acetone and 49.9% water (v/v/v/v) (mobile phase B, flow rate at 0.6 mL/min).
PMC5739065	R02009	For the HILIC cartridge, the polar urine extracts were loaded using a combination of 0.1% formic acid, 10% IPA, 89.9% hexane (v/v/v) (mobile phase A, flow rate at 1.5 mL/min), and small molecules were eluted using the same mobile phase B as used for the C18 cartridge.
PMC5739065	R02012	The sample injection sipper and valve loops were washed with water followed by acetonitrile between each sample injection.
PMC5739065	R03001	A classic example involves fructose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, and glucose-1-phosphate, which are all endogenous metabolites of importance in glucose metabolism.
PMC5739065	R03003	demonstrates the resolving power of IMS-MS in separation of these compounds where fructose-6-phosphate has the smallest structure (as indicated by the shortest drift time) and glucose-1-phosphate the largest (longest drift time).
PMC5739065	R03004	IMS spectra for the deprotonated isomers of a) fructose-6-phosphate, glucose-6-phoshate, and glucose-1-phosphate and b) 2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene, 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene and 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene.
PMC5739065	R03007	A 6-point calibration curve for 20 xenobiotics analyzed individually in water/methanol with varying concentrations (10 pM, 100 pM, 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM, and 1 μM).
PMC5739065	R03009	Similarly, IMS-MS was used to resolve three xenobiotic dihydroxynaphthalene isomers having different hydroxyl placements (2,6; 2,3; and 1,5).
PMC5739065	R03010	As shown in , IMS-MS easily distinguished 1,5-dihydroxynaphthalene from the other two isomers, but 2,6 and 2,3-dihydroxynaphthalene had similar drift times.
PMC5739065	R03011	2,6-dihydroxynaphthalene, however, was observed to have the smallest structure of the three isomers.
PMC5739065	R05002	In one example, chloramphenicol (CAP) was quantified by spiking light (L; unlabeled) and heavy (H; deuterium-labeled) CAP; into human plasma at varying concentrations.
PMC5739065	R05003	CAP is an antibiotic useful in the treatment of bacterial infections, but is only recommended when safer antibiotics cannot be used; thus, understanding how different levels of CAP affect endogenous metabolites is of interest.
PMC5739065	R05004	To demonstrate quantitation of CAP in human plasma samples, heavy CAP, labeled with 5 deuterium atoms (d5-CAP), was spiked into each sample at a fixed concentration of 10 nM, while light (unlabeled) CAP was spiked at concentrations ranging from 1 nM to 100 nM. All samples were then analyzed using SPE-IMS-MS.
PMC5739065	R05005	The peak intensities of the heavy and light CAP molecules at each L/H concentration ratio are presented in .
PMC5739065	R05009	The peak intensity values for light and heavy CAP were observed with varying concentration ratios, which correlated with their spiking level (L/H from 0.1 to 10).
PMC5739065	R06002	demonstrates detection of the pharmaceutical tiabendazole (TAE), which was spiked into human plasma and urine, at a concentration of 1 nM. TAE occurred during the 3-s SPE-IMS-MS peak elution time and each sample was analyzed using a 10-s sample-to-sample cycle time to account for cartridge equilibration and sample loading.
PMC5739065	R06003	While TAE was virtually isolated in plasma, one small molecule in urine had a similar m/z value, but was easily separated from TAE with IMS.
PMC5739065	R06004	This allowed for the confident identification of TAE and demonstrated the utility of IMS for reducing false positives in targeted and untargeted analyses of complex biofluids.
PMC5739065	R06005	Three-second SPE-IMS-MS analyses of a) human plasma and b) urine extracts with spiked xenobiotics, including 1 nM of tiabendazole.
PMC5739065	R06008	Tiabendazole at 1 nM was detected in both human plasma and urine extracts with similar signal intensities.
PMC5739065	R07005	The graphitic carbon cartridge preferentially retains hydrophilic chemicals, particularly those with planar structures (such as creatinine and disaccharides).
PMC5739065	R07007	Finally, the HILIC cartridge favors smaller hydrophilic molecules (e.g. , choline and monosaccharides) and on average detected 371 features in positive ion mode and 58 in negative ion mode.
PMC5739065	R07022	From these analyses, it was determined that the peak intensity of endogenous metabolites related to energy metabolism (e.g., creatinine), amino acids (e.g., phenylalanine and dimethylarginine), and nucleic acids (e.g., hypoxanthine, 1-methyladenosine and N2, N2-dimethylguanosine) did not significantly change between the T1D patients and their sibling controls.
PMC5739065	R07023	However, the disaccharides (i.e., sucrose and lactose) had statistically significant increases in peak intensity in the T1D patients.
PMC5739065	R07024	Because the resolving power of the IMS used in this study was not able to separate sucrose and lactose, they were both reanalyzed with GC–MS and found to both be significantly higher in the T1D patients.
PMC5813015	D00004	Over time several alterations on metabolite concentrations have been described in the blood of DS in comparison with control subjects: i) increased levels of phenylalanine and tyrosine in blood serum following 1-phenylalanine load and due to lower hydroxylation rate of phenylalanine; ii) lower plasma levels of free histidine, lysine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, leucine, isoleucine and tryptophan; iii) increased plasma concentrations of leucine, isoleucine, cysteine and phenylalanine at an age vulnerable to Alzheimer changes; iv) decreased plasma concentration of serine at any age, possibly due to a dosage effect of the gene for cystathionine beta synthase (CSB), located on Hsa21; v) increased plasma lysine concentration in patients above 10 years old, possibly due to premature aging.
PMC5813015	D00005	More recently, concentrations of metabolites related to the methylation cycle such as cysteine, cystathionine, choline and dimethylglycine concentrations were found to be significantly elevated in DS plasma by MS analysis, as well as S-adenosylhomocysteine and S-adenosylmethionine plasma level that however were found to be decreased in a previous report.
PMC5813015	D00008	A urine tyrosyl radical produced from the oxidation of L-tyrosine by the myeloperoxidase-H_2 O_2 system of macrophages and neutrophilis, has been proposed as an oxidative stress biomarker in hypothyroid DS children.
PMC5813015	D00009	Metabolomic studies were also conducted on amniotic fluid samples from fetuses with DS compared with those of non-syndromic fetuses by MS analysis showing an elevation of phenylpyruvate that inhibits the metabolism of tetrahydrobiopterin; decreased levels of glycine and glutamate, involved in the neurotransmission processes, and an increased level of glutamine were also measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
PMC5813015	D00038	Interestingly, the metabolites we found increased are pyruvate, which connects Krebs cycle and glycolysis; fumarate and succinate intermediates of Krebs cycle; lactate, the end product of anaerobic glycolysis; formate, involved in mitochondrial one-carbon metabolism; and creatine, involved in the process of energy-dependent muscle activity.
PMC5813015	D00039	It is important to underline that the increment of pyruvate, succinate, formate and creatine are significant in terms of p_FDR and classified as medium or large in terms of Cliff’s delta (Tables  and ).
PMC5813015	D00044	Consistent with our results, impairment of certain enzymes of Krebs cycle (i.e. aconitase and NADP-linked isocitrate dehydrogenase) have been reported in the heart of DS fetuses and brain regions of subjects with DS.
PMC5813015	D00045	The increase of plasma lactate we found in DS samples is consistent with the increase of basal levels of lactate found in fibroblasts from DS patients and supports the hypothesis that in DS cells, in which the OXPHOS is impaired, DS cells activate glycolysis for their energy demands.
PMC5813015	D00046	Consistently, also in another neurodevelopmental disease such as the autism spectrum disorder associated with mitochondrial metabolism impairment, abnormal levels of metabolites associated with activation of glycolysis like serum lactate and pyruvate were found.
PMC5813015	D00047	Very interesting and new data is the increase of plasma creatine in DS samples.
PMC5813015	D00048	Creatine is phosphorylated in mitochondria by ATP derived from oxidative phosphorylation and the phosphocreatine, subsequently exported outside mitochondria, used by the cytosolic creatine kinase to resupply ATP for muscle activity.
PMC5813015	D00049	We can suppose that plasma accumulation of creatine, probably due to the OXPHOS impairment, could account for the muscle weakness, another typical DS phenotype.
PMC5813015	D00052	Impairment of the methyl cycle has been actually documented and also affects mitochondrial methyl availability and glutathione levels in DS.
PMC5813015	D00054	By HLPC, they found, for example, a decrease of tyrosine in DS compared with controls.
PMC5813015	D00055	Here, we also observed decreased tyrosine levels (not significant in terms of p_FDR but classified as medium in terms of Cliff’s delta (Tables  and )) with a ratio DS/control = 0.87, which was near the 2:3 ratio.
PMC5813015	D00056	Tyrosine is a precursor of thyroid hormones, whose level is often decreased in DS, so it would be interesting to test the hypothesis of a correlation between tyrosine and thyroid hormones in subjects with DS.
PMC5813015	D00057	Our preliminary analysis failed to find such a correlation when routine laboratory analysis data for thyroid hormone levels in the children investigated here were correlated to plasma tyrosine levels.
PMC5813015	D00063	S-adenosylhomocysteine and S-adenosylmethionine plasma level were decreased according to Pogribna and Coll., and increased according to Obeid and Coll..

PMC5813015	D00078	A lower number of metabolites was found to be altered by univariate analysis (none significant in terms of p_FDR , except for leucine in fasting subjects)
PMC5813015	D00080	Higher levels of citrate have been previously reported in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymphoblastoid cells from children with DS.
PMC5813015	D00081	Here, we found an increase of citrate in urine of fasting subjects with a ratio DS/control = 1.33, which was near the 3:2 ratio, although the differences in citrate levels between the two groups are not significant.
PMC5813015	D00084	FTCD enzyme is involved in the most common inborn error of folate metabolism due to an autosomal recessive disorder causing a glutamate formiminotransferase deficiency.
PMC5813015	D00085	This enzyme catalyzes two reactions of the histidine metabolism, in particular the degradation of N-formimino-L-glutamic acid to form 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate, L-glutamate, and ammonia (KEGG pathway 2.1.2.5, Supplementary Table _S4 ).
PMC5813015	D00086	L-glutamate is one of the compounds having an increased level in DS urine of the fasting group subjects, not significant in terms of p_FDR but classified as medium in terms of Cliff’s delta (Table ).
PMC5813015	D00092	Another interesting metabolite that, although not significant in terms of p_FDR but classified as medium in terms of Cliff’s delta, increases in urine is TMAO.
PMC5813015	D00094	A literature analysis confirmed that TMAO is a gut-microbiota-dependent metabolite, and several works also reveal that TMAO has a role in the onset of cardiovascular diseases and kidney diseases.
PMC5813015	D00099	These bacteria are positively associated with TMAO levels, so further analysis could be conducted to understand its association with DS.
PMC5813015	D00109	The “blocked” mechanism that determines ID severity and specific molecule protagonists of this complex mechanism might be identified, as occurred for other complex diseases: “Phenylketonuria, galactosemia, vitamine B6 dependant homocystinuria, to take few examples, can be properly handled and the children protected against mental deficiency.

PMC5813015	R02017	When all subjects were considered irrespectively of the fasting state, phenylacetylglycine, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and tyrosine were significantly increased in DS with a DS/CTRL ratio > 1; instead, glycine was reduced in DS with a DS/CTRL ratio < 1 (Table ).
PMC5813015	R02025	When fasting subjects were selected, ethanolamine, glutamate + glutamine and phenylacetylglycine were significantly increased in DS with a DS/CTRL ratio > 1; instead, leucine was significantly reduced in DS with a DS/CTRL ratio < 1 (Table ).

PMC5836369	A01008	Although adiponectin levels have been repeatedly reported to be lower in GDM women and closely associated with plasma glucose concentrations of OGTT, the area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve of adiponectin was relatively low (–).
PMC5836369	A01011	With respect to GDM, higher levels of homocysteine have been found by Guven et al. .

PMC5864028	A00003	We were able to identify several metabolites whose concentrations were significantly higher in the urine samples of CT-positive subjects, including sucrose, mannitol, pyruvate and lactate.
PMC5864028	A00004	In contrast, higher urinary levels of acetone represented the main feature of CT-negative women.
PMC5864028	A00006	Since the presence of sugars can increase the stability of chlamydial proteins, higher levels of sucrose and mannitol in the urethral lumen, related to a higher sugar consumption, could have favoured CT infection acquisition or could have been of aid for the bacterial viability.
PMC5864028	A00008	Lactate and pyruvate could result from CT-induced immunopathology, as a product of the inflammatory microenvironment.
PMC5864028	D00003	By means of a _1 H-NMR analysis, we were able to identify several metabolites whose concentrations were significantly higher in the urine samples of CT-positive subjects, including sucrose, mannitol, pyruvate and lactate.
PMC5864028	D00005	At first, we hypothesized that a higher level of sucrose in the urethral lumen, related to a higher sugar consumption, could have favored CT acquisition or delayed its clearance.
PMC5864028	D00006	Indeed, it has been shown that urinary sucrose is a biomarker for total sugar consumption, considering that the diet-intake of sucrose is significantly correlated with its concentration in urines [, ].
PMC5864028	D00007	In this context, it has been demonstrated that sucrose can increase the stability of chlamydial proteins (i.e. MOMP: major outer membrane proteins), thus potentially leading to a longer viability of CT elementary bodies.
PMC5864028	D00008	In a similar way, mannitol, a sugar alcohol often found in hard candies, fruits and vegetables, could act as a ‘stabilizer’ of proteins and membranes, lengthening the bacterial viability [–].
PMC5864028	D00009	Second, we highlighted a significant difference in the concentration of 2-furoylglycine and acetone between the study groups.
PMC5864028	D00010	It has been shown that 2-furoylglycine at the urinary level can be considered as a biomarker of caffeine consumption and, in addition, can derive from furan derivatives found in food prepared by strong heating.
PMC5864028	D00011	Contrariwise, the urinary excretion rate of acetone, one of the ketone bodies, is found to be higher during fasting or low-sugar diet.
PMC5864028	D00013	Finally, we supposed that the presence of higher levels of pyruvate and lactate in urines of infected women could be ascribed to CT-induced immunopathology.
PMC5864028	D00016	A key feature of the inflammatory microenvironment is the accumulation of lactate, a by-product of highly proliferating cells during the glycolytic pathway [, ].
PMC5864028	D00018	This change leads to the up-regulation of glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters to the membrane, with an increase in glycolytic flux and the concomitant production of lactate, derived from the conversion of pyruvate [–].
PMC5864028	D00019	In this context metabolomics has been recently and successfully employed to show that the accumulation of lactate is a marker of inflammation in several organs and tissues [–].
PMC5864028	M01004	After the PCR step, the amplified product was digested with AluI, DdeI and/or HinfI as restriction enzymes (Promega, Madison, USA) and visualized after electrophoresis run in ethidium bromide stained 12% polyacrylamide gel.
PMC5864028	M02002	After centrifugation for 15 min at 18630 g at 4°C, an amount of supernatant equal to 700 μL was added to 200 μL of a D_2 O solution of 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid (TSP) sodium salt 10 mM, buffered at pH 7.00 ± 0.02 by means of 1M phosphate buffer.
PMC5864028	M02005	Urine samples were centrifuged and 700 μl of the supernatant were added to 0.2 mL of 3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid (TSP) sodium salt 10 mM in deuterated water.
PMC5864028	M02017	The spectra were aligned towards the right peak of alanine doublet, set to 1.473 ppm, and the signals of water and urea were removed.
PMC5864028	M02023	In order to compensate for differences in solids content, any other sample was then normalized to such sample by means of probabilistic quotient normalization, set up so to exclude spectra portions ascribed to water and urea.
PMC5864028	R02005	In particular, higher concentrations of 2-furoylglycine, sucrose, threonine, methylsuccinate, lactate, mannitol and pyruvate were found in CT-positive subjects, whereas CT-negative patients were characterized by higher levels of acetone, hypoxanthine and methylguanidine.
PMC5864028	R02017	The correlation between the concentration of each molecule and its importance over PC1 served as a handy way to rank the molecules in order of importance in determining such grouping, with high concentrations of sucrose and low concentrations of acetone representing the main features of C .

PMC5869879	R00018	Literature and modelled results of acetate, alanine, threonine and TTMethylHistidine Measured chemical shift changes for acetate, alanine, threonine and TTMethylHistidine with the fit of the theoretical model   
PMC5869879	R01003	Taurine is a good example of this, as shown in Fig. , where it can be seen that one pKa lies at pH 1.5, while the data only cover the pH range 3.2–12.
PMC5869879	R01004	Examples of resonances with incorrectly estimated numbers of sites: taurine, citrate, creatinine, imidazole with literature pKa values (yellow line) and fitted pKa values (green line)  
PMC5869879	R01006	The δ 2.7 resonance of citrate is a good example of this, as in Fig. , where the smooth titration curve around pH 4–5 does not suggest the presence of the third pKa at 4.75.
PMC5869879	R01007	A third type of incorrect estmate happens when the change of chemical shift is too small so that the transition can not be detected near the pKa value, for instance creatinine as shown in Fig. .
PMC5869879	R01008	Conversely, the change in the chemical shift can be too large compared to the estimated measurement error, for example imidazole as shown in Fig. , forming a fourth type of inaccuracy.
PMC5887308	A02000	While corroborating several earlier findings when comparing cases and controls and the effects of the antipsychotic medication, we also found that prospective weight gain in psychotic patients was associated with increased levels of triacylglycerols with low carbon number and double-bond count at baseline and independent of obesity,
PMC5905995	D00010	In terms of metabolomics profiling, we found that the metabolites higher in Cluster 2 compared to Cluster 1 may be involved in pathways related to lipid metabolism through endocannabinoid-related systems that can modulate cancer cell growth and proliferation (N-Acylethanolamines and Anandamide biosynthesis)

PMC5905995	R01003	The fold-difference of the known metabolites was calculated and three (threonine minor, 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid 1) had a fold change greater than 2, when comparing Cluster 1 to Cluster 2.
PMC5905995	R02002	Tumors of breast cancer patients in Cluster 2 tended to be estrogen receptor (ER) positive (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 0.68–6.43).
PMC5920367	A00006	The present study indicated that 4-heptanone, 2-methylpyrazine, 2-methylbutanal, 2,6-dimethyl-7-octen-2-ol and decanoic acid may serve as potential biomarkers for B-NHL.
PMC5920367	D00003	In the present study, the concentration levels of 3 volatile metabolites (4-heptanone, 2-methylpyrazine and 2-methylbutanal) in urine samples from patients with B-NHL were significantly higher compared with non-lymphoma subjects, and the concentration of 1 of the metabolites (4-heptanone) was significantly different between early and advanced stages of lymphoma, indicating that 4-heptanone may be a potentially useful biomarker for screening of B-NHL.
PMC5920367	D00007	In the present study, 4-heptanone, 2-methylbutanal and decanoic acid were identified as novel volatile biomarkers with satisfactory accuracy to differentiate aggressive B-NHL from indolent B-NHL.
PMC5920367	D00020	In the present study, the concentrations of 3 VOCs (4-heptanone, 2-methylpyrazine and 2-methylbutanal) were significantly different between the B-NHL group and healthy control group.
PMC5920367	D00021	However, only 1 VOC, 4-heptanone, was able to distinguish B-NHL from benign lymphatic disease.
PMC5920367	D00027	It has been reported that 4-heptanone is a β-oxidation product of 2-ethylhexanoic acid from plasticizers in a study on the in vivo metabolism of humans.
PMC5920367	D00028	Since plasticizers are considered as carcinogen, 4-heptanone can be an exogenous biomarker for B-NHL.
PMC5920367	D00029	Hanai et al detected increased concentrations of 2-methylpyrazine in the urine of human lung tumor-bearing mice.
PMC5920367	D00030	Nevertheless, 2-methylpyrazine was not considered as a suitable candidate for lung cancer biomarker, since it was not likely to be released from lung cancer cell.
PMC5920367	D00031	A study by Calejo et al revealed that 2-methylbutanal had a higher level of concentration in the urine samples of smokers compared with non-smokers.
PMC5920367	D00032	The authors suggested that 2-methylbutanal as a potentially useful biomarker to identify smoking habits.
PMC5920367	D00033	However in the present study, smokers were excluded, which indicates that there are different sources of 2-methylbutanal.
PMC5920367	D00034	Previous studies indicated that abnormal expression of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase in cancer may increase aldehyde levels (,).
PMC5920367	D00035	However, the association between the enzymes and 2-methylbutanal has not been demonstrated.
PMC5920367	D00036	Another potential biomarker, 2,6-dimethyl-7-octen-2-ol, had been identified in urine samples from patients with prostate cancer, and the diagnostic value of 2,6-dimethyl-7-octen-2-ol was similar to PSA.
PMC5920367	D00037	Decanoic acid was detected in several types of fats and may be responsible for the mitochondrial proliferation associated with the ketogenic diet (,).
PMC5920367	D00038	To date, decanoic acid has not been reported to be a biomarker of cancer.

PMC5924413	M10000	This validated LC–MS/MS method was successfully applied to a clinical study involving quantification of D-mannose in human serum in a set of 643 serum samples which included earlystage EAC patients (N = 145), late-stage EAC patients (N = 175),and healthy controls (N = 323) matched by age and gender.
PMC5924413	M10006	After quantification and quality control analyses, Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the D-mannose concentration levels between the EAC cases and healthy controls.
PMC5924413	R00000	D-mannose is notoriously difficult to accurately quantify due to its coelution or closely eluting peaks with other endogenous epimers of D-mannose such as D-glucose, D-fructose and, D-galactose.
PMC5924413	R00004	Since D-mannose has the same molecular weight as D-glucose, D-galactose and D-fructose, this column will separate the epimers by ligand-exchenge.
PMC5924413	R00009	The retention time was 15.76 min for D-glucose, 18.95 min for D-galactose, 20.38 min for both D-mannose and IS, and 21.50 min for D-fructose.
PMC5924413	R00010	This method provided clear separation of the mono-sugars and therefore, D-glucose, D-galactose, and D-fructose do not co-elute with D-mannose.
PMC5924413	R00011	A stable isotope of D-mannose was selected as the IS, which is the best choice for a LC–MS/MS analysis because it can effectively compensate for variability such as in ionization efficiency, stability, and extraction recovery.
PMC5924413	R00014	The data showed that this simple method successfully separated D-mannose from glucose with no interferential peaks.
PMC5924413	R01002	This result proved that surrogate serum was equivalent to real human serum in this LC–MS/MS analysis of D-mannose.
PMC5924413	R02002	Since D-mannose is endogenous compound, and the concentration of D-mannose in normal human serum was reported to be 3.6–7.2 μg/mL
PMC5924413	R02006	The mean extraction recovery for D-mannose was 104.13, 105.53, and 104.84, for the low, medium, and high QC concentrations, respectively.

PMC5924413	R02016	Stability studies were conducted to evaluate the stability of D-mannose under expected sample handling and storage conditions.
PMC5924413	R02020	This data indicates that D-mannose in human serum is stable after at least 24 h at room temperature on the bench-top, after three freeze-thaw cycles, after 24 h in the auto-sampler at 15 °C, and after at least 14 days at −80°C.

PMC5928440	A00000	Eicosanoids, including prostaglandins (PGs) and thromboxanes, are broadly bioactive lipid mediators and increase colon tumorigenesis possibly through chronic inflammatory mechanisms.
PMC5928440	A00001	Epidemiological and experimental data suggest that acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) helps prevent colorectal cancer (CRC), possibly through cyclooxygenase (COX)-mediated suppression of eicosanoid, particularly PGE_2 , formation.
PMC5928440	A00002	Recent studies suggest that statins prevent CRC and improve survival after diagnosis.
PMC5928440	A00003	We identified patients on ASA and/or statin treatment undergoing routine colonoscopy and measured eicosanoid levels in colonic mucosa with targeted metabolomics technology (LC-MS/MS).
PMC5928440	A00004	ASA-treated individuals (n = 27) had significantly lower tissue eicosanoid levels of most COX-derived metabolites than untreated individuals (n = 31).
PMC5928440	A00005	In contrast, COX-derived lipid metabolites tended to be higher in patients with statin treatment (n = 7) as compared with those not receiving statins (n = 24).
PMC5928440	A00006	This effect was not discernible in subjects treated with ASA and statins (n = 11): Individuals treated with both drugs showed a pronounced suppression of COX-derived eicosanoids in colon tissue, even compared with subjects treated with ASA alone.
PMC5928440	A00007	Our data from a routine clinical setting support the hypothesis that ASA and statins could inhibit CRC development via lipid mediator modification.
PMC5928440	A00008	Further studies should directly investigate the effect of dual ASA and statin treatment on colon tumorigenesis in humans.
PMC5928440	A01000	colorectal cancer, lipidomics, cyclooxygenase, arachidonic acid, acetylsalicylic acid
PMC5928440	A02001	Numerous epidemiological and observational studies show that long-term low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) intake reduces the incidence of CRC and that postdiagnosis ASA therapy exerts positive effects on CRC overall survival (, ).
PMC5928440	A02002	Prostaglandin (PG)E_2 , one of the main cyclooxygenase (COX) products suppressed by the COX-inhibitor, ASA, has a well-established pro-tumorigenic role in CRC development (–) and oral treatment with ASA was found to decrease colonic tissue PGE_2 levels in individuals suffering from CRC.
PMC5928440	A02003	Several studies have shown that treatment with ASA or other COX-inhibitors (, ) can suppress the development of colonic neoplasia by suppressing the formation of colon polyps (–), which are neoplastic precursor lesions leading to most CRCs (, ).
PMC5928440	A02004	The preventive effect of ASA might thus occur within normal (neither neoplastic nor inflamed) colon mucosa.
PMC5928440	A02005	The protection from CRC in individuals treated with aspirin becomes visible in the rates of CRC incidence 8–10 years after the beginning of aspirin administration.
PMC5928440	A02006	This observation also supports the thesis of an early effect of aspirin treatment on healthy colonic mucosa.
PMC5928440	A02007	In addition, a role in colon tumorigenesis chemoprevention has been postulated for statins (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors), which are widely used for the reduction of serum cholesterol levels in the prevention of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events.
PMC5928440	A02008	A large population-based case-control study demonstrated a relative risk reduction for CRC development for statin treatment over 5 years.
PMC5928440	A02010	Furthermore, statin use was found to be associated with a reduced incidence of advanced colorectal adenoma, suggesting a preventive role in the malignant transformation of adenomatous tissue (, ).
PMC5928440	A02012	The effect of statin treatment on eicosanoid formation is controversial, with studies demonstrating increased eicosanoid formation due to statin use (–) as compared with other data indicating suppression of eicosanoid formation (–).
PMC5928440	A02013	Both drugs can modify the product spectrum of COX-2: While COX-2 acetylation by aspirin blocks prostanoid and 11-H(p)ETE formation, acetylated COX-2 still leads to the formation of 15-HETE (–).
PMC5928440	A02014	Interestingly, statins were shown to modulate COX-2 activity by increasing inducible nitric oxide synthase and S-nitrosylation of COX-2.
PMC5928440	A02015	15-HETE is a pathway marker of anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving lipoxins (–).
PMC5928440	A02016	Similarly, acetylated COX-2 enhances formation of EPA-derived 18-hydroxy eicosapentaenoic acid (HEPE) and DHA-derived 17-hydroxy
PMC5928440	A02018	The induction of those metabolites by aspirin or statin treatment could therefore contribute to a low-grade anti-inflammatory effect in the colon mucosa.
PMC5928440	A02019	In this context, the current study was designed to investigate the profile of eicosanoids and other oxylipins in healthy colonic mucosa biopsies from individuals without or with ASA and/or statin treatment.
PMC5928440	D00000	This study examined differences in eicosanoid and other oxylipin levels in human colonic tissue from individuals receiving aspirin and/or statin treatment, two widely prescribed drugs with an attributed protective role in colorectal carcinogenesis.
PMC5928440	D00001	Aspirin-treated individuals had significantly lower PG and Tx tissue levels than untreated subjects, reflecting the ASA-mediated COX inhibition.
PMC5928440	D00002	PGs exert pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects in different pathophysiological settings and different tissue types.
PMC5928440	D00007	Our data provide insight into colonic lipid metabolism under the influence of ASA medication in healthy humans and supports the widely hypothesized anti-tumorigenic effect due to aspirin’s effect on PG suppression.
PMC5928440	D00009	At least in healthy colon tissue, our findings do not support this hypothesis, as 5-LOX-derived eicosanoid levels remained essentially unaffected upon ASA treatment.
PMC5928440	D00010	With respect to changes in the hydroxy-PUFAs formed as side products by COX-2, ASA-treated subjects had significantly lower levels of 11-HETE, 9-HODE, and 13-HDHA compared with untreated individuals.
PMC5928440	D00011	In vitro data shows that ASA-acetylated COX-2 forms (hydroperoxy-)15-HETE and thereby induces the formation of 15-HETE-derived anti-inflammatory metabolites (, , ).
PMC5928440	D00012	Correspondingly, the n3-PUFA-derived metabolites, 17-HDHA and 18-HEPE, were shown to be formed by acetylated COX-2 and function as precursors of highly potent specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators.
PMC5928440	D00013	A redirection of COX-2 metabolism toward 15-HETE and its anti-inflammatory lipoxin derivates upon ASA treatment has been demonstrated in rat hepatocytes and human lung cancer cell lines.
PMC5928440	D00014	Furthermore, aspirin treatment led to the production of biologically active lipoxins in colon tissue of patients suffering from ulcerative colitis in vitro.
PMC5928440	D00015	In this study, we found no suppression of 15-HETE, 17- HDHA, and 18-HEPE levels in the colon mucosa of ASA-treated individuals compared with untreated subjects, while 11-HETE, 9-HODE, and 13-HDHA levels were significantly lower, comparable to the observed decrease in prostanoid levels.
PMC5928440	D00016	Compared with other studies (, , , ), we found an unchanged concentration and did not see higher levels of the acetylated-COX-2 hydro(pero)xy-PUFA in aspirin-treated patients compared with untreated patients.
PMC5928440	D00018	As the analysis of COX-1/COX-2 expression in tissue samples was impossible in this study due to lack of sufficient amounts of sample material for oxylipin and protein analysis, this should be addressed in future studies.
PMC5928440	D00021	With regard to the impact of statins on the AA cascade, effective COX-2 mRNA suppression has been shown in the small nonpolyp intestine of multiple intestinal neoplasia mice upon oral pitavastatin treatment.
PMC5928440	D00022	This is not in line with our findings, as we detected a trend to increased PG and Tx levels in colon tissue of statin-treated individuals compared with untreated subjects, but changes did not reach statistical significance.
PMC5928440	D00023	In agreement with our findings, investigations in rat myocardial tissue and human umbilical venous endothelial cells described an upregulation of COX-2 upon atorvastatin treatment leading to increased levels of 15d-PGJ_2 , a product of PGD_2 .
PMC5928440	D00024	As we were able to detect slightly higher levels of the COX-2 byproducts, 15-HETE, 13-HDHA, and 17-HDHA, in individuals under statin treatment compared with untreated or ASA-treated subjects, there could be a combined effect of statin treatment to induce COX-2 expression and activation by S-nitrosylation leading to increased formation of 15-HETE, 13-HDHA, and 17-HDHA (, , ).
PMC5928440	D00026	Surprisingly, colon tissue levels of most COX-derived metabolites were notably lower in individuals under dual ASA and statin treatment compared with untreated subjects or subjects on ASA medication alone.
PMC5928440	D00027	The investigation of interaction between ASA and statin medication revealed remarkably small P values, which could suggest a synergistic effect of ASA and statins on lowering colonic tissue PG levels.
PMC5928440	D00028	It should be noted that COX products from different PUFAs and their metabolites showed the described tissue level differences consistently, whereas LOX- and CYP-pathway product concentrations remained unaffected by ASA treatment.
PMC5928440	D00029	To our knowledge, this potentially synergistic effect of aspirin and statins on eicosanoid level suppression in human colonic mucosa has not been described before.
PMC5928440	D00030	Cell culture experiments and investigations in animal models of colorectal carcinogenesis showed that comedication with COX-inhibitors and statins has synergistic effects on colon tumorigenesis prevention and induction of apoptosis, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown (–).
PMC5928440	D00031	While a large population-based case-control study did not provide evidence of an interaction between statins and COX inhibitors, another study detected a stronger CRC risk reduction for the combination of both drugs.
PMC5928440	D00032	A limitation of the data presented here is that underlying medical conditions leading to the prescription of either ASA and/or statins may affect colon tissue lipid metabolite levels themselves.
PMC5928440	D00033	Furthermore, individuals without ASA and/or statin treatment were significantly younger than individuals receiving these treatments.
PMC5928440	D00034	The effects on colonic oxylipin levels of both, underlying medical conditions and age, could not be determined within this study design.
PMC5928440	D00037	Our study is the first to quantify a wide range of eicosanoids and other oxylipins in human colon biopsy samples of individuals under aspirin and statin treatment, indicating that both drugs mainly affect the levels of COX-derived metabolites.
PMC5928440	D00038	While persons taking aspirin had significantly lower PG and Tx tissue levels, statin-treated individuals showed a trend toward increased tissue levels of these metabolites.
PMC5928440	D00039	Patients under dual treatment, however, presented with a pronounced decrease of many PG and Tx levels, even in comparison to individuals under ASA monotherapy, possibly indicating a synergistic effect of both drugs.
PMC5928440	D00040	Our data add convincing human data from a routine clinical setting to support the hypotheses put forward in many studies arguing that lipid mediator modification effects might contribute to the chemopreventive effect of ASA (and statins) in the context of colon tumorigenesis.
PMC5928440	D00041	Further studies are now necessary to directly investigate how dual ASA and statin treatment affects colon tumorigenesis in humans.

PMC5928440	M02006	Subsequently, two-way ANOVA was used to test for interaction between ASA and statin medication in the ASA-treated patients; results of this testing are shown in and supplemental Table S2.

PMC5928440	R00001	Patients in the study group without ASA and statin medication were younger than individuals in the ASA-treated study group (P < 0.01).
PMC5928440	R00003	Twenty-six out of 27 individuals under ASA treatment were on a daily dose of 100 mg ASA, while one individual took 250 mg ASA per day.

PMC5928440	R00006	The number of patients suffering from arterial hypertension and taking cardiac medication (including angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, diuretics, and β blockers) was higher in the study groups with ASA, statin, or dual therapy.
PMC5928440	R01000	The most abundant PGs in human colorectal tissue samples were PGD_2 , 6-keto-PGF_1α , and PGE_2 .
PMC5928440	R01002	ASA-treated individuals showed significantly lower tissue levels of 6-keto-PGF_1α , PGF_2a , PGD_2 , PGJ_2 , and TxB_2 than individuals without ASA medication.
PMC5928440	R01004	The EPA-derived metabolites, PGE_3 , PGD_3 , and TxB_3 , were also significantly lower in ASA-treated individuals compared with untreated subjects, as were dihommo γ-linolenic acid (DGLA)-derived metabolites, PGE_1 and PGD_1 .
PMC5928440	R01005	Monohydroxy oxylipins were also assessed, and while levels of the arachidonic acid (AA)-derived COX-metabolite 11-HETE were significantly lower in ASA-treated patients compared with untreated subjects, 15-HETE as well as EPA-derived HEPEs, 15-HEPE and 18-HEPE, did not show differences in tissue levels between patients treated with ASA and those without ASA.
PMC5928440	R01008	The most abundant hydroxy PUFA in human colorectal tissue samples was the linoleic acid (LA)-derived metabolite, 9-HODE.

PMC5928440	R02000	Next, we analyzed whether statin treatment had an effect on the assayed PG and monohydroxy metabolites in the subset of patients not treated with ASA.
PMC5928440	R02001	Colon tissue from statin-treated patients had higher levels of these PGs and Txs in comparison to untreated patients.
PMC5928440	R02003	There was also a trend toward higher monohydroxy metabolites derived from AA, EPA, DHA, and LA, such as 11-HETE, 15-HEPE, 18-HEPE, and 9-HODE.
PMC5928440	R02004	While these higher amounts were most notable for 15-HETE and 17-HDHA, even these differences were not significant.

PMC5928440	R03000	Given the finding of an oxylipin-lowering effect of ASA in contrast to a trend toward an increase of oxylipins in colon tissue from statin-treated patients, we then decided to analyze the subset of patients with ASA-only treatment versus those receiving ASA and statin medication.
PMC5928440	R03001	Interestingly, we observed markedly lower tissue PG levels in individuals simultaneously receiving ASA and statin treatment, as compared with untreated individuals or subjects receiving ASA monotherapy.
PMC5928440	R03002	Statistical testing for interaction between the effects of ASA and statin medication yielded P values <0.05 for the metabolites, PGF_2a , PGE_2 , PGD_2 , PGJ_2 , PGE_3 , PGD_3 , 11-HETE, and 13-HDHA, pointing toward the possibility of a synergistic effect of ASA and statin medication on PG suppression.

PMC5929433	A00005	The Cancer Genome Atlas was used to analyze gene expression related to the sphingolipid metabolism.

PMC5929433	A00007	Substrates and enzymes that generate ceramide were significantly increased in all three ceramide biosynthesis pathways in cancer.
PMC5929433	A00008	Further, higher levels of ceramide in breast cancer were associated with less aggressive cancer biology presented by Ki-67 index and nuclear grade of the cancer.
PMC5929433	A00009	Interestingly, patients with higher gene expressions of enzymes in the three major ceramide synthesis pathways showed significantly worse prognosis.
PMC5929433	A00010	This is the first study to reveal the clinical relevance of ceramide metabolism in breast cancer patients.
PMC5929433	A00011	We demonstrated that ceramide levels in breast cancer tissue were significantly higher than those in normal tissue, with activation of the three ceramide biosynthesis pathways.
PMC5929433	A00012	We also identified that ceramide levels have a significant association with aggressive phenotype and its enzymes have prognostic impact on breast cancer patients.

PMC5929433	D00000	This is the first study to demonstrate the clinical relevance of ceramide levels in breast cancer patients.
PMC5929433	D00001	The dynamic balance between S1P and sphingosine/ceramide is referred to as the “sphingolipid rheostat” and influences cancer cell fate.
PMC5929433	D00002	Several studies have reported that ceramide is intimately involved in cancer pathogenesis.
PMC5929433	D00004	However, the clinical relevance of ceramide levels in patients with breast cancer remains unclear, due to lack of accurate measurement of ceramides in human patients.
PMC5929433	D00005	In this current study, we used human breast cancer tissue and demonstrated that human breast cancer and not the peri-tumor or normal breast tissue has relatively high ceramide expression.
PMC5929433	D00006	Moreover, both substrates and enzymes of all three ceramide-biosynthesis pathways were elevated in cancer tissue, and ceramide levels were inversely associated with aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer.
PMC5929433	D00008	previously reported that the levels of ceramide in breast cancer tissue were higher than that of normal breast tissue.
PMC5929433	D00013	To date, our study represents the largest cohort of breast cancer patients used to investigate the levels of ceramide in human breast cancer.
PMC5929433	D00014	Unlike our previous reports where levels of S1P, sphingomyelin, and monohexocylceramide in breast cancer tissue were associated with levels in normal breast tissue among individual patients [, ], in this study we found that the ceramide levels of breast cancer tissue were not associated with those of normal breast tissue.
PMC5929433	D00015	In our previous study, we reported that the production of ceramide occurs independently from the condition of the host because apoptotic cells are considered to be a major source of ceramides in the cancer tissue.
PMC5929433	D00016	In the present study, we clearly demonstrated that ceramide levels were increased to the highest levels within cancer and IF and to lower levels within the surrounding normal breast tissue, serum, or plasma.
PMC5929433	D00017	Considering that ceramide inhibits the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which are proteolytic enzymes that play a critical role of tumor invasion and metastasis, ceramides may suppress cancer progression without being secreted into the systemic circulation.
PMC5929433	D00018	In contrast to S1P, which acts as mediator inside and outside of cancer cells to promote their progression, ceramides may act differently in breast cancer tissue.
PMC5929433	D00019	We also investigated the potential pathways that could be associated with increased ceramide expression in breast cancer tissue.
PMC5929433	D00020	Our data, using measurement of each sphingolipid substrate and enzyme gene expression analysis, demonstrated that all three ceramide-biosynthesis pathways are activated to increase ceramides in human cancer.
PMC5929433	D00021	It is reasonable to hypothesize that increased expression of ceramide biosynthetic enzyme levels does not necessarily imply that there is an increase in enzymatic activity since many enzymes are regulated by posttranslational modifications.
PMC5929433	D00022	Considering that both the expression of ceramide biosynthetic enzyme levels and the levels of ceramide were higher in breast cancer tissue than in normal tissue, it logically follows that the enzymatic activity would be higher in breast cancer tissue.
PMC5929433	D00023	In the present study, we found that Ki-67 and nuclear grade were negatively associated or had a trend toward negative association with the ceramide level in cancer tissue.
PMC5929433	D00024	The high levels of ceramide in breast cancer tissue were significantly associated with low cell proliferation potency.
PMC5929433	D00025	There have been reports demonstrating the role of ceramide on cancer cell biology in vivo and in vitro [, ].
PMC5929433	D00026	It has been shown that ceramide increases apoptosis in a dose dependent manner in human colon carcinoma cells and in MCF-7 breast cancer cells.
PMC5929433	D00028	It has also been shown that blocking ceramide synthase decreases apoptosis in a xenograft model of human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
PMC5929433	D00029	Moreover, models of metastases, ceramide sensitized metastatic cancer cells to apoptosis.
PMC5929433	D00030	Consistent with apoptosis sensitization activity, subtoxic doses of ceramide suppressed the metastatic potential of colon cancer cells in an experimental lung metastasis mouse model, as well as breast cancer growth and spontaneous lung metastasis in a breast cancer mouse model.
PMC5929433	D00031	Taken together, these in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that ceramide increases apoptosis in a dose dependent manner, regardless of the cancer cell origin.
PMC5929433	D00032	These in vivo and in vitro studies support our clinical results, which revealed that high ceramide levels in breast cancer were associated with less aggressiveness of cancer.
PMC5929433	D00034	Interestingly, the prognostic evaluation suggested that the ceramide-related enzymes related to increased ceramide expression were associated with worse survival in breast cancer patients.
PMC5929433	D00035	Given that ceramide is one of the components of the cellular membrane, cancer cells with a high proliferation rate would be expected to require more ceramide.
PMC5929433	D00036	Ceramide also plays a role in apoptosis in cancer tissue.
PMC5929433	D00037	In the context of the “sphingolipid rheostat” that converts ceramide produced in cancer tissue into S1P, it is reasonable to hypothesize that cancer cells may become more aggressive from high levels of S1P converted from ceramide.
PMC5929433	D00038	Indeed, we found that a high ratio of S1P to ceramide was associated with high proliferation potency, reflected to the high Ki-67 index and nuclear grade.
PMC5929433	D00039	Therefore, it appears that the worse prognosis of patients with high expression of ceramide-related enzymes was due to S1P converted from ceramide by the “sphingolipid rheostat”.
PMC5929433	D00041	Recently, ORMDLs have emerged as key proteins for maintaining sphingolipid homeostasis.
PMC5929433	D00042	ORMDLs act as negative regulators of sphingolipid synthesis that form a conserved complex with serine palmitoyltransferase, the first and rate-limiting enzyme in sphingolipid production.
PMC5929433	D00043	ORMDLs may also “sense” ceramide and decrease its synthesis through negative feedback mechanisms [–].
PMC5929433	D00044	Our findings suggest that the low ORMDL expression may result in dysregulation of sphingolipid homeostasis, which leads to worse prognosis for the patients.
PMC5929433	D00046	Ceramide is receiving a lot of attention in clinical research [, ].
PMC5929433	D00047	Sphingolipids including ceramide have been implicated in the mechanism of action of cancer chemotherapeutics [–].
PMC5929433	D00048	It has been shown that ceramide is a key regulator of the taxane-mediated spindle assembly checkpoint and taxane-induced cell death.
PMC5929433	D00050	Pro-apoptotic ceramide was significantly lower in all patients after chemotherapy, suggesting that downregulation of ceramide is a common feature of breast cancer patients in response to chemotherapy.
PMC5929433	D00051	Stimulating ceramide or decreasing catabolic enzymes such as UGCG can potentially be useful for breast cancer treatment.
PMC5929433	D00052	Additionally, ceramide has also been evaluated as a diagnostic biomarker.
PMC5929433	D00053	Serum levels of sphingolipid metabolites have been shown to have a significant upregulation in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as compared to patients with cirrhosis.
PMC5929433	D00054	Specifically, C16-ceramide levels may serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker for the identification of HCC in patients with liver diseases.
PMC5929433	D00058	Nonetheless, our study represents the largest cohort of patients used to investigate the levels of and potential role of ceramide in human breast cancer.
PMC5929433	D00059	Future studies using larger cohorts may provide additional information regarding the association between ceramide levels and subtypes of breast cancer or the association between ceramide levels and drug-resistance.
PMC5929433	D00061	Thus, this represents an important limitation in addressing sphingolipid metabolism at the individual cell level.
PMC5929433	D00062	Moreover, the mass spectrometric analysis was limited to specific fractions of sphingolipids.
PMC5929433	D00063	Other sphingolipids that are not easily determined by mass spectrometry but may play a role in carcinogenesis, such as gangliosides, were not included in this study.
PMC5929433	D00065	We did not conduct any experiments to reveal correlation between ceramide metabolism and breast cancer cell biology.
PMC5929433	D00066	With that said, there has been numerous in vivo and in vitro studies that revealed correlation between ceramides and tumor biology by the others [–].
PMC5929433	D00067	Our results are in agreement with the previous studies, and we reported the association between ceramides and human breast cancer utilizing clinical samples for the first time.
PMC5929433	D00068	This is the first study to elucidate the clinical relevance of ceramide metabolism in breast cancer patients.
PMC5929433	D00069	We demonstrated that ceramide levels in breast cancer tissue are significantly higher than those in normal tissue, with activation of the three ceramide biosynthesis pathways.
PMC5929433	D00070	Further, we demonstrated that ceramide levels in breast cancer tissue are inversely associated with aggressive phenotype.
PMC5929433	D00071	Moreover, we showed the prognostic impact of the activation status of enzymes in the three ceramide synthetic pathways.
PMC5929433	D00072	Further studies are needed to reveal the underlying mechanisms of how ceramide and sphingolipid homeostasis affect oncologic processes in breast cancer patients.
PMC5929433	M01000	We utilized our established method to measure sphingolipids within the tissue samples obtained from this patient cohort [, ].
PMC5929433	M01001	Internal standards were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL, USA) and added to samples in 20 μl of an ethanol: methanol: water (7:2:1) cocktail of 500 pmol each.
PMC5929433	M01003	Lipids were extracted from tissue, and sphingolipids were quantified by LC-ESIMS/MS (4000 QTRAP, ABI) as described previously by our group [, ].
PMC5929433	M02000	To evaluate the expression level of each gene encoding enzymes involved in the three ceramide production pathways (i.e. salvage pathway, sphingomyelin pathway, and the de novo pathway), the RNA-sequence gene expression quantification data of breast cancer tissue (n = 112) and paired normal breast tissue (n = 112) were retrieved from the Genomics Data Commons (GDC) data portal.
PMC5929433	M04003	Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to compare ceramide levels between cancer tissue and normal breast tissue as well as cancer tissue and peri-tumor tissue.
PMC5929433	R00002	Thirty-four (77.3%) patients were estrogen receptor (ER) positive, and 15 patients (34.1%) were HER2 positive.
PMC5929433	R00003	There was significant difference between the level of total ceramide in breast cancer tissues and hormone receptor status.
PMC5929433	R00004	In the present study, the total ceramide means refers to the sum of ceramides from C_14:0 to C_26:1 , not including ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P).
PMC5929433	R00005	The total ceramide level was higher in hormone receptor positive breast cancer than in negative breast cancer.
PMC5929433	R00007	Interestingly, there was no significant difference in ceramide levels between patients with lymph node metastasis and those without.
PMC5929433	R00009	Conversely, there was a significant difference in S1P levels as reported previously (Table ).
PMC5929433	R01000	We measured the ceramide levels in breast cancer (n=44), peri-tumor (n=36), and normal breast tissues (n=44) (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R01001	The levels of total ceramide in cancer tissue were significantly higher compared to normal breast tissue (n=44, p <0.0001) or peri-tumor tissues (n=36, p <0.0001) (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R01002	Elevation of levels in cancer compared to peri-tumor or normal breast tissue were consistent throughout all ceramide species (C14:0, C16:0, C18:1, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0, C24:1, C24:0, C26:1 and C26:0) (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R01003	(A, B), Levels of total ceramide (Cer)
PMC5929433	R01004	(A) and each ceramide specie (C14:0, C16:0, C18:1, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0, C24:1, C24:0, C26:1 and C26:0) (B) in cancer tissue (Cancer or C), peri-tumor tissue (Peri or P) and normal tissue (Normal or N) were determined by mass spectrometry.
PMC5929433	R01007	(C, D), Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were produced to assess the ability of our ceramide assays to distinguish cancer tissue from either normal breast tissue sample (C) or peri-tumor tissue (D).
PMC5929433	R01008	(E, F), Correlation between the ceramide level in breast cancer tissue and that in normal breast tissue (E) or peri-tumor (F) were compared in individual patient.
PMC5929433	R01010	(G) The ceramide levels in interstitial fluid (IF) of cancer tissue and normal breast tissue were determined.
PMC5929433	R01011	(H, I) Correlation between the ceramide level in breast cancer tissue and that in serum (H) or plasma (I) were compared.
PMC5929433	R01013	Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were used to assess the prognostic ability of ceramide levels to distinguish cancer tissue from either normal breast tissue (Figure ) or peri-tumor tissue (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R01014	The AUC scores were 0.7226 for normal tissue (Figure ) and 0.7228 for peri-tumor tissue (Figure ), respectively, showing that breast cancer tissue may be distinguished from normal breast tissue by ceramide levels.
PMC5929433	R01015	We analyzed the correlation between the ceramide level of breast cancer tissue and that of normal breast tissue (Figure ), or peri-tumor in individual patients (Figure ), and found no correlation between them (R_2 =0.00, p=0.38, and R_2 =0.00, p=0.35, respectively).
PMC5929433	R01016	The ceramide levels in interstitial fluid (IF) of cancer tissue were significantly higher than those of normal breast tissue (p =0.018)
PMC5929433	R01018	On the other hand, the serum and plasma ceramide levels of breast cancer patients, of which 19 patients were available for analysis, were not associated with ceramide level in cancer tissue of each patient (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R01019	These results suggest that ceramides are present in tumor microenvironment, but do not leak out from the tumor into the systemic circulation.
PMC5929433	R02000	We investigated the salvage pathway, one of the three major pathways of ceramide biosynthesis, as a source of ceramide in human breast cancer tissues (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R02001	Levels of monohexocylceramide, which is the core molecule of many glycosphingolipids involved in the salvage pathway, were measured in the breast cancer patient cohort.
PMC5929433	R02002	Total monohexocylceramide levels as well as levels of all the monohexocylceramide species were significantly higher in cancer tissue than that in peri-tumor or in normal breast tissue (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R02003	These results suggest that all of the monohexocylceramide species as well as the total amount of monohexocylceramides were significantly higher in cancer.
PMC5929433	R02004	(A, B) Levels of total monohexocylceramide (HexCer) (A) and each monohexocylceramide specie (C14:0, C16:0, C18:1, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0, C24:1, C24:0, C26:1 and C26:0) (B) in cancer tissue (Cancer or C), peri-tumor tissue (Peri or P) and normal tissue (Normal or N) were determined by mass spectrometry.
PMC5929433	R02008	The expression of glucosylceramidase (GBA) and uridine diphosphoglucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n=112) were analyzed.
PMC5929433	R02011	To evaluate the expression levels of ceramide-producing enzymes in the salvage pathway, gene expression of glucosylceramidase (GBA), encoding a lysosomal membrane protein that generates ceramide, was analyzed in the TCGA cohort.
PMC5929433	R02013	The expression levels of uridine diphosphoglucose ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG) were also significantly higher in breast cancer tissue than in paired normal breast tissue (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R02014	We next investigated the sphingomyelin pathway, another major pathway of ceramide biosynthesis.
PMC5929433	R02015	All sphingomyelin species were significantly higher in cancer tissue than that in peri-tumor or normal breast tissue, as well as the total levels of sphingomyelin determined by mass spectrometry (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R02016	In order to examine whether the sphingomyelin pathway is involved in increased production of ceramides in cancer, expression of three genes that code enzymes related to ceramide metabolism were analyzed.
PMC5929433	R02017	These included sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 2 (SMPD2), sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 4 (SMPD4), and sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 5 (SMPD5).
PMC5929433	R02018	These enzymes regulate sphingomyelinase to increase ceramide biosynthesis as well as sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SGMS2), which regulates sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase to increase conversion of ceramide to sphingomyelin.
PMC5929433	R02020	(A, B) Levels of total sphingomyelin (SM) (A) and each sphingomyelin species (C14:0, C16:0, C18:1, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0, C24:1, C24:0, C26:1 and C26:0) (B) in cancer tissue (Cancer or C), peri-tumor tissue (Peri or P) and normal tissue (Normal or N) were determined by mass spectrometry.
PMC5929433	R02024	The expression of sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 2 (SMPD2), sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 4 (SMPD4), sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 5 (SMPD5) and sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SGMS2) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n=112) were analyzed.
PMC5929433	R02027	As for the de novo pathway, the levels of all dihydroceramide species, which serve as the precursor of ceramide in the de novo pathway, were significantly higher in cancer tissue than that in peri-tumor or normal breast tissue (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R02028	In order to determine whether the de novo pathway contributes to the increase of ceramides in cancer, gene expression of dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES-1), an enzyme that converts dihydroceramide to ceramide in the de novo pathway, was measured.
PMC5929433	R02030	Taken together, these findings suggest that both the amount of the substrates and the expression of the ceramide-producing enzymes were increased in all of the three major ceramide synthesis pathways in breast cancer compared to normal breast tissue.
PMC5929433	R02031	(A, B) Levels of total dihydroceramide (DH-Cer) (A) and each dihydroceramide species (C14:0, C16:0, C18:1, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0, C24:1, C24:0, C26:1 and C26:0) (B) in cancer tissue (Cancer or C), peri-tumor tissue (Peri or P) and normal tissue (Normal or N) were determined by mass spectrometry.
PMC5929433	R02035	The expression of Dihydroceramide desaturase 1 (DES1) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n=112) were analyzed.
PMC5929433	R03000	Ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) is generated through direct phosphorylation of ceramide by ceramide kinase (CERK).
PMC5929433	R03002	In this study, we decided not to measure the C1P levels, but rather analyzed the gene expression of CERK.
PMC5929433	R03003	This is because C1P has been shown to be too unstable to obtain any reliable measurements by our technique.
PMC5929433	R03005	The gene expression of N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase (ASAH) catalyzes the hydrolysis of the N-acyl linkage of ceramide to generate sphingosine (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R03007	At the same time, the gene expression of ceramide synthases (CS), including CS2, CS4, CS5, and CS6, which generate ceramide from sphingosine, were significantly increased (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R03008	The gene expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1 (SGPL1) which executes the final decisive step of the sphingolipid breakdown pathway, mediating the irreversible cleavage of the lipid-signaling molecule S1P, was also significantly increased in cancer (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R03009	In summary, we found that substrates to generate ceramide, including monohexocylceramide in the salvage pathway, sphingomyelin in the sphingomyelin pathway, and dihydroceramide in the de novo pathway were all significantly increased in cancer.
PMC5929433	R03010	Further, we found that gene expression of the enzymes that generate ceramide (GBA in the salvage pathway, SMPD in the sphingomyelin pathway, DES1 in the de novo pathway, and ceramide synthases in the catabolic pathway) were significantly increased in breast cancer.
PMC5929433	R03012	The expression of genes related to the other sphingolipid metabolic pathways in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort (n=112) were analyzed.
PMC5929433	R04000	To determine the role of ceramide in breast cancer aggressiveness, we next investigated the relationship between the levels of total ceramide in breast cancer tissue and cell proliferation potency, using Ki-67 index and nuclear grade.
PMC5929433	R04001	Patients with high Ki67 labelling index (>30) showed significantly lower ceramide levels in cancer tissue than those with low Ki-67 index (≤30) (p =0.04)
PMC5929433	R04003	In investigating the association between ceramide levels and Ki-67 index within each individual patient, ceramide in cancer tissue showed a trend toward a negative association (R_2 =0.05) with levels of Ki-67 index (p =0.09)
PMC5929433	R04005	Regarding nuclear grade, patients with high nuclear grade were significantly associated with low ceramide levels in cancer tissue (p =0.04) as shown in Figure .
PMC5929433	R04006	For an individual patient, ceramide levels in cancer tissue showed a significant negative association with nuclear grade (p =0.04)
PMC5929433	R04008	(A) The comparison of ceramide levels in breast cancer tissue between patients with Ki-67 index.
PMC5929433	R04011	(B) The comparison of ceramide levels in breast cancer tissue between patients with high nuclear grade (Nuclear Grade 3) and patients with low nuclear grade (Nuclear Grade 1 and 2).
PMC5929433	R04015	The correlation between ceramide levels in breast cancer tissue and Ki-67 index.
PMC5929433	R04018	The correlation between ceramide levels in breast cancer tissue and nuclear grade.
PMC5929433	R04020	(E) The comparison of the ratio of S1P to ceramide in breast cancer tissue between patients with high Ki-67 index and patients with low Ki-67 index.
PMC5929433	R04023	(F) The comparison of the ratio of S1P to ceramide in breast cancer tissue between patients with high nuclear grade (Nuclear Grade 3) and patients with low nuclear grade (Nuclear Grade 1 and 2).
PMC5929433	R04026	(G) The correlation between the ratio of S1P to ceramide in breast cancer tissue and Ki-67 index.
PMC5929433	R04029	The correlation between the ratio of S1P to ceramide in breast cancer tissue and nuclear grade.
PMC5929433	R05000	We next investigated the relationship between the ratio of S1P to ceramide levels in breast cancer tissue and cell proliferation potency.
PMC5929433	R05002	Patients with high Ki-67 (>30) had a significantly higher ratio of S1P to ceramide in cancer tissue than those with a low Ki-67 index (≤30) (p=0.03) (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R05003	In investigating the association between the ratio of S1P to ceramide and Ki-67 index within each individual patient, the high ratio of S1P to ceramide was significantly associated with the high levels of Ki-67 index (p=0.04) (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R05004	Regarding nuclear grade, high nuclear grade was significantly associated with a high ratio of S1P to ceramide in cancer tissue (p=0.04) as shown in Figure .
PMC5929433	R05005	For individual patients, the ratio of S1P to ceramide showed a trend toward a positive association (R_2 =0.07) with levels of nuclear grade (p=0.18) (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R06002	ORMDL, a group of genes of the Orm family, acts as a key homeostatic regulator of sphingolipid metabolism, and decreases ceramide levels through inhibition of serine palmitoyltransferase.
PMC5929433	R06004	Second, we evaluated the association of survival with each gene encoding ceramide-related enzymes in the three major pathways of ceramide synthesis.
PMC5929433	R06005	Regarding the sphingomyelin pathway (Figure ), the patients with high levels of SMPD (SMPD2 and SMPD3) showed significantly worse prognosis (Figure ).
PMC5929433	R06007	Taken together, the survival analyses of gene expression suggested that the ceramide-related enzymes that generate ceramide have an association with worse survival in breast cancer patients.
PMC5929433	R06008	The gene expression levels of enzymes related to ceramide metabolism in breast cancer tissue were examined from TCGA cohort (A-V).
PMC5955890	A00002	The results indicated a lower level of aspartate, alanine, choline, glutamate, and glutarate in SSc patients compared with healthy controls.
PMC5955890	A00004	The multivariate analysis performed using all the metabolites significantly different revealed glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, energetic pathways, glutamate metabolism, degradation of ketone bodies and pyruvate metabolism as the most important networks.
PMC5955890	A00005	Aspartate, alanine and citrate yielded a high area under receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves (AUC of 0.81; CI 0.726–0.93) for discriminating SSc patients from controls, whereas ROC curve generated with acetate, fructose, glutamate, glutamine, glycerol and glutarate (AUC of 0.84; CI 0.7–0.98) discriminated between lcSSc and dcSSc.
PMC5955890	D00002	Citrate content was significantly decreased in serum of SSc patients compared to controls.
PMC5955890	D00003	Citrate is a crucial molecule in the metabolism of energy production.
PMC5955890	D00004	After its synthesis in the mitochondria, this metabolite could be employed in the Krebs cycle to promote the oxidative phosphorylation with a resulting ATP production.
PMC5955890	D00006	The altered blood level of the intermediates of the Krebs cycle, like the citric acid, in SSc samples could be explained by the high consumption to supply the energy deficiency.
PMC5955890	D00007	In addition to its primary role in the cellular energy production, citric acid has been demonstrated to have important immunologic properties, modulating the pro-inflammatory processes in macrophages.
PMC5955890	D00008	Furthermore, in line with our finding, several studies reported a decreased level of citric acid in urine and serum of patients affected by immune-mediate disease.
PMC5955890	D00009	In particular, Alonso et al . detected lower level of citrate in patients affected by psoriasis and SLE underlining a key-role of this metabolite in immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.
PMC5955890	D00010	Similarly, the low level of L-alanine, and L-lysine found in SSc patients may be ascribed to the metabolites employment in the regulation of inflammatory and autoimmune response.
PMC5955890	D00011	Aspartate was another interesting metabolite that we found decreased in the SSc patients.
PMC5955890	D00012	Aspartate plays an important role in the metabolism and functions of leucocytes.
PMC5955890	D00013	Moreover, as a substrate for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides, aspartate is crucial for the proliferation of lymphocytes.
PMC5955890	D00014	The metabolic pathway analysis identify some relevant metabolic nets mainly including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, pathways related to the energetic metabolism, butanoate metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism.
PMC5955890	D00019	Moreover, it has been shown that, in response to cellular changes of glucose levels, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways are strictly and mutually regulated.
PMC5955890	D00023	Glycolysis has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis and the activity levels of two major enzymes of the glycolytic pathway – glyceraldehydes 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and lactate dehydrogenase – were increased in the synovial cells.
PMC5955890	D00032	In addition to glucose, amino acids are have an important role for T cells as a prime source of energy and as a substrate for protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis.
PMC5955890	D00033	Glutamate is a substrate for the synthesis of γ-aminobutyrate (GABA), which is present in both lymphocytes and macrophages.
PMC5955890	D00035	Moreover, glutamate, an immediate precursor for glutathione, plays a regulatory role in its synthesis, removing oxidants.
PMC5955890	D00036	Glutamine, increased in patients with lcSSc, is a relevant energy substrate for cells of the immune system, playing an important role in their function and homeostasis.
PMC5955890	D00037	Glutamine, but not glutamate, uptake is enhanced during T-cell activation.
PMC5955890	D00038	This may explain the increase of glutamate and the decrease of glutamine in patients with dcSSc compared to lcSSc patients.
PMC5955890	D00039	In addition to be essential for protein synthesis, glutamine contributes to other processes important for proliferating T cells, including fatty acid synthesis, synthesis of purine and pyrimidine nucleotides.
PMC5955890	D00040	In line with our results recent studies on the metabolic fingerprint of inflammatory disease based on an autoimmune process, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis, alanine and citrate were identified as discriminant metabolites.
PMC5955890	D00041	This finding suggest a non-specific role for alanine and citrate in SSc.
PMC5955890	D00042	On the contrary aspartate has been found to be discriminant in systemic sclerosis but not in the other inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.
PMC5955890	M02001	The concentrated water-phase was resuspended in 630 µl of D2O and 70 µl trimethylsilyl propanoic acid (TSP) 5.07 mM. TSP was added to provide an internal reference for the chemical shifts (0 ppm), and 650 µl of the solution were transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube.
PMC5955890	M03002	Derivatization was made adding to dried samples 100 μL of methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine solution (10 mg/mL) for 17 hr.

PMC5955890	R01024	The results indicated a significant decreased level of aspartate, alanine, choline, glutamate and glutarate and an increased concentration of glutamine in the SSc compared to healthy control group.
PMC5955890	R01031	The pathways analysis, performed using all the significantly different metabolites resulting from the multivariate analysis, underlined glycolysis or gluconeogenesis, butanoate metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism and energetic pathways like, pentose phosphate metabolism, synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies and pyruvate metabolism as the most important networks (Fig. ).
PMC5955890	R01038	(B) ROC curve generated with the relative concentrations of discriminant metabolites (alanine, aspartate and citrate) that were significantly different between HC and SSc both by NMR and GC-MS analysis.
PMC5955890	R01039	To evaluate the presence of possible diagnostic biomarkers, the predictive capability of the discriminant metabolites common in both _1 H-NMR and MS techniques (aspartate, alanine and citrate) was tested through the ROC curve analysis.
PMC5955890	R01053	The _1 H-NMR analysis identified an increased levels of valine, acetate, fructose, glutamate, glycerol, and lysine in the dcSSc class, while lcSSc patients showed enhanced concentrations of sugars, lactate, glutamine.
PMC5955890	R01054	The spectra obtained by GC-MS analysis, indicated a decreased presence of sugars and sorbitol and an increased concentration of glycerate and glutarate in the dcSSc samples compared to lcSSc.
PMC5955890	R01057	The pathway analysis performed using Mataboanalyst 3.0, considering all significantly different metabolites, revealed glutamine and glutamate metabolism, glycolysis, gluconeogenesis and pathways involved in the energy production as the most important pathways.

PMC6016785	D00008	By interrogating tumor metabolic reprogramming in BCC by DESI-MSI, we identified a marked increase in relative and absolute abundances of FAs, especially arachidonic acid FA (20:4), and certain complex glycerophospholipids, such as glycerophosphoglycerol 34:1 and glycerophosphoserine 36:1.
PMC6016785	D00011	In particular, FA (20:4), or arachidonic acid, is a precursor of prostaglandins that were shown to be elevated in BCC compared with normal skin, and are predictive of tumor aggressiveness (, ).
PMC6016785	D00012	FAs are then incorporated into complex glycerophospholipids, which further promote biomass growth by providing building blocks and suitable physical properties to dividing cell membranes, acting as signaling mediators and regulating energy metabolism in cells.
PMC6016785	D00013	However, not all glycerophospholipids and their precursors are elevated in BCC, and the tumors present rather differential regulation of metabolites.
PMC6016785	D00014	Thus, glycerophosphocholine PC 34:1 and glycerophosphoinositol 38:4 show lower abundances in tumor region.
PMC6016785	D00015	In addition, the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate demonstrates markedly depleted levels in BCC aggregates probably owing to the increased rate of cataplerosis in tumor.
PMC6016785	M01017	The tissue sections were carefully removed from glass slides, and the lipids were extracted in 500 µL of methanol:water 70:30 solution.
PMC6016785	R01001	This range allowed the detection of free fatty acids (FAs) (m /z 200–400), FA dimeric clusters (m /z 500–600), and complex glycerophospholipids (m /z 700–1,000).
PMC6016785	R01007	It should be noted that tandem-MS experiments were necessary to determine the exact length of acyl groups in glycerophospholipids, whereas the position and stereochemistry of the double bonds in FAs and glycerophospholipids could not be accurately assigned even following tandem-MS experiments.
PMC6016785	R01008	In particular, BCC nests were distinctively rich in arachidonic acid, FA (20:4) (m /z 303.3), and glycerophosphoglycerol 34:1, PG (18:1/16:0) (m /z 747.6), and they demonstrated high relative and total abundances of oleic acid, FA (18:1) (m /z 281.3);

PMC6016785	R01011	Among other molecular ions abundant in BCC regions, we could identify FA dimers at m /z 537.4 (oleic acid + palmitic acid), m /z 563.5 (oleic acid + oleic acid), and m /z 585.5 (oleic acid + arachidonic acid), as well as phospholipids, glycerophosphoglycerol 36:2, PG (18:1/18:1) at m /z 773.6 (SI Appendix , Fig.

PMC6016785	R01016	In the adjacent normal skin, a very prominent peak was detected at m /z 465.4 and was unambiguously identified by high-accuracy MS and sulfur isotopic distribution as cholesterol sulfate.
PMC6016785	R01017	Cholesterol sulfate demonstrated markedly higher relative and absolute abundances in normal skin regions than in BCC lesions.
PMC6016785	R01019	Cholesterol sulfate is an important metabolite produced by sun-exposed skin that has been shown to have a variety of physiological functions (, ) and was also linked to skin carcinogenesis inhibition.
PMC6016785	R01021	Compared with BCC aggregates, normal skin regions exhibited lower relative and absolute abundances of arachidonic acid, FA (20:4) (m /z 303.3), and glycerophosphoglycerol 34:1, PG (18:1/16:0) (m /z 747.6), and showed a presence of chloride adducts of glycerophosphocholines (PCs), including glycerophosphocholine PC 34:1, PC (18:0/16:1) at m /z 794.4, and glycerophosphocholine 34:2, PC (18:1/16:1) at m /z 792.4 (SI Appendix , Fig.

PMC6016785	R02026	Because fumarate is one of the key intermediates in the Krebs cycle, its levels may be disrupted by aberrant metabolism of tumors that drive toward cataplerotic production of lipids and metabolites required for cell proliferation.
PMC6016785	R02027	Previously, fumarate has been shown to inhibit chemical carcinogenesis in mouse skin.
PMC6020709	A02000	TB patients presented with wasting disease, represented by decreased amino acid levels including histidine and alanine.
PMC6020709	A02001	Conversely, DM patients were dyslipidemic as evidenced by high levels of very low-density lipoprotein triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
PMC6020709	A02002	TB-DM patients displayed metabolic characteristics of both wasting and dyslipidemia combined with disease interaction-specific increases in phospholipid metabolites (e.g. sphingomyelins) and atherogenic remnant-like lipoprotein particles.
PMC6020709	A02003	Biomarker analysis identified the ratios of phenylalanine/histidine and esterified cholesterol/sphingomyelin as markers for TB classification regardless of DM-status.
PMC6020709	D00002	Our results show that plasma from patients with TB displayed signatures of extensive wasting, represented by lower levels of amino acids, cholesterol, fatty acids and phospholipid metabolites, while conversely DM was associated with dyslipidemia.
PMC6020709	D00003	Plasma from TB-DM patients showed the most prominent metabolic characteristics of both diseases, i.e. wasting, exemplified by reduced concentrations of amino acids (histidine, alanine, glutamine), and dyslipidemia in the form of high levels of VLDL-TG and low HDL cholesterol.
PMC6020709	D00008	The formation of remnant-like particles depends on the relative contributions of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hepatic triglyceride lipase (HTGL) to lipoprotein hydrolysis: the former initiates the cascade through lipolysis of chylomicrons and nascent VLDL while the latter preferentially converts smaller VLDL and IDL particles to LDL.
PMC6020709	D00012	Additionally, TB-DM interaction leads to a specific increase in sphingomyelins and related phospholipid metabolites.
PMC6020709	D00013	It has been demonstrated that hepatic sphingolipid synthesis is increased under inflammatory conditions, specifically through increased levels of the rate-limiting enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT).
PMC6020709	D00014	High levels of circulating sphingomyelin are associated with coronary artery disease as they increase the atherogenic potential of lipoproteins and also function as a physiological inhibitor of HTGL activity.
PMC6020709	D00015	The ratio of histidine/phenylalanine in plasma was a potential biomarker for TB irrespective of DM-status.
PMC6020709	D00016	This result is congruent with earlier metabolomic profiling of TB which reported changes in histidine and/or phenylalanine metabolism in plasma and urine, and will require further validation in independent cohorts with larger sample sizes.
PMC6020709	D00017	It is possible that a decreased histidine/phenylalanine ratio reflects non-specific oxidative stress and/or inflammation as similar changes were demonstrated in other inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, obesity and cancer.
PMC6020709	D00018	Furthermore, TB disease status was associated with a decreased ratio of esterified to free cholesterol in plasma.
PMC6020709	D00019	Cholesterol esterification is regulated by lecithin–cholesterol acyltransferase
PMC6020709	D00021	A possible explanation for this shift is the ability of sphingomyelin to inhibit LCAT activity [,] as the esterified cholesterol/sphingomyelin ratio also showed strong predictive power, particularly in TB-DM patients.
PMC6020709	D00028	Interestingly, we find that TB leads to increased plasma levels of β-hydroxybutyrate, a ketone body which has been implicated in Mtb -induced intracellular lipid droplet formation.
PMC6020709	D00033	Firstly, differences in both the DM and TB-DM populations could be related to the use of anti-diabetic medication such as insulin, metformin or statins, all of which affect glucose and lipid metabolism.
PMC6020709	D00039	In conclusion, TB-DM comorbidity results in a distinctive lipid profile with pro-atherogenic properties, including significantly elevated levels of sphingomyelins and remnant-like lipoprotein particles.
PMC6020709	D00043	Statin or other lipid-lowering treatments could be started in case of aberrant lipid levels or existing cardiovascular malconditions.
PMC6020709	D00044	Furthermore, systematically determining TG and/or cholesterol levels at TB diagnosis could help identifying patients at risk.
PMC6020709	R01020	As expected, the primary parameter associated with DM was increased plasma glucose (p  = 1.83E_−16 ; p- values reported here are from multivariate analyses) (b).
PMC6020709	R01021	DM patients showed major hallmarks of dyslipidemia, namely high levels of VLDL-triglycerides (VLDL-TG) (p  = 5.72E_−7 ) (a), VLDL-cholesterol (VLDL-C)
PMC6020709	R01026	Furthermore, DM patients had increased amounts of branched-chain amino acids (valine (p  = 0.011), leucine (p  = 0.093), isoleucine (p  = 1.29E_−4 ) (h)), a subclass of amino acids associated with insulin resistance, while glutamine levels were lower (p  = 5.50E_−4 )
PMC6020709	R01029	Most notably, TB patients had low levels of amino acids (e.g. histidine (p  = 5.36E_−10 ) (e), glutamine (p  = 7.38E_−4 )
PMC6020709	R01030	(g), alanine (p  = 1.29E_−4 )), serum cholesterol (p  = 1.72E_−4 ) and total fatty acids (p  = 1.32E_−3 ), including a prominent reduction in polyunsaturated fatty acids (p  
PMC6020709	R01031	= 3.36E_−6 ), as well as decreased amounts of phospholipid metabolites.
PMC6020709	R01032	Except for inflammation marker Gp (glycoprotein acetylation) (p  = 4.12E_−8 ) (l), TB patients only displayed elevated levels of two metabolites: phenylalanine (p
PMC6020709	R01033	 = 3.07E_−4 ) (f), an aromatic amino acid, and β-hydroxybutyrate (p  = 0.017)
PMC6020709	R01034	(k), a ketone body.
PMC6020709	R02001	Compared to DM (e), TB-DM patients showed a similar metabolic signature as TB vs. HC, i.e. reduced levels of amino acids (e.g. histidine (p  = 8.87E_−11 ) (e), alanine (p  = 6.02E_−8 ))
PMC6020709	R02002	combined with increased concentrations of phenylalanine (p  = 8.57E_−8 ) (f) and β-hydroxybutyrate (p  = 0.013)
PMC6020709	R02004	Although serum cholesterol and total fatty acids were unaffected (p  = 0.738 and 0.692 respectively), VLDL-TG levels were lower in TB-DM compared to DM patients (p  = 6.40E_−3 ) (a), which is consistent with a decreased amount of VLDL particles (XL to M) (j).
PMC6020709	R02007	Importantly, TB-DM patients displayed major hallmarks of DM when compared to the TB group (a), namely elevated plasma concentrations of glucose (p  = 6.21E_−9 ), VLDL-TG (p  = 5.37E_−4 ) (a), ApoB (p  = 8.06E_−3 ), VLDL-C (p  = 4.43E_−4 ),
PMC6020709	R02008	total fatty acids (p  = 5.37E_−4 ) and branched-chain amino acids (valine (p  = 0.016), leucine (p  = 0.016), isoleucine (p  = 3.41E_−3 ) (h)).
PMC6020709	R02009	Moreover, TB-DM comorbidity reduced glutamine levels even further compared to either TB or DM alone (p  = 0.036 and 7.19E_−4 respectively)
PMC6020709	R03002	We identified a TB-DM interaction-specific increase in phospholipid metabolite levels (a), i.e. sphingomyelins (p  = 5.57E_−3 )
PMC6020709	R03003	(i), phosphatidylcholine (p  = 0.054), total cholines (p  = 0.017)

PMC6020709	R03008	= 7.80E_−3 , 8.40E_−3 and 7.18E_−3 , respectively), which could be driven by a relative enrichment of LDL particle TG content (Fig.
PMC6020709	R04004	The histidine/phenylalanine ratio was the biomarker with the highest accuracy for classifying TB-DM vs. DM (AUC: 0.957, 95% CI: 0.895–0.993, a) and the second highest for TB vs. HC (AUC: 0.903, 95%CI: 0.846–0.955, c).
PMC6020709	R04005	Interestingly, a decreased ratio of esterified to free cholesterol (c) also showed strong predictive power for TB in both groups, with AUCs of 0.885 (95% CI: 0.815–0.938) and 0.902 (95% CI: 0.828–0.963) for TB and TB-DM respectively.
PMC6020709	R04006	The ratio of esterified cholesterol/sphingomyelin was especially predictive of TB in comorbidity patients (AUC: 0.933, 95% CI: 0.870–0.983, b), but also apparent without DM (AUC: 0.854, 95%CI: 0.776–0.928, d).

PMC6112131	A00001	Apart from this and only recently recognized, NT-proBNP levels associate with higher HDL- and lower LDL-cholesterol levels comprising a favorable blood lipid profile.
PMC6112131	D01000	In general, low HDL-cholesterol and high LDL-cholesterol are significantly associated with the risk to develop CVD.
PMC6112131	D01002	Our findings are in line with an observation among 680 elderly volunteers with NT-proBNP levels below 100 ng/L exhibiting an inverse association between BNP and non-HDL cholesterol.
PMC6112131	D01003	Likewise, Takeuchi et al. observed a strong inverse correlation between serum BNP concentrations and total cholesterol in a population of patients.
PMC6112131	D01004	In older adults free of cardiovascular or kidney disease increased levels of NT-proBNP related to lower LDL-cholesterol and higher HDL-cholesterol.
PMC6112131	D02002	Besides its main metabolic role in glucose homeostasis, adiponectin is also implicated in many other metabolic and inflammatory functions, including for instance tissue regeneration and proliferation and function of sebocytes.
PMC6112131	D02012	BNP brain natriuretic peptide; NPR-A natriuretic peptide receptor A, GTP guanosine triphosphate, cGMP cyclic guanosine monophosphate, PKG cGMP-dependent protein kinase, HDL high-density lipoprotein, VLDL very low-density lipoprotein, IDL intermediate-density lipoprotein, LDL low-density lipoprotein
PMC6112131	D02016	In line with this, in patients with T2DM levels of circulating adiponectin was lower in serum compared to normoglycemic subjects and vascular free radical formation related to NADPH oxidase was increased, which in turn activated PVAT to increase adiponectin expression in response to increased free radical formation.
PMC6112131	D03001	Several associated metabolites, e.g. uridine in plasma as well as adenosine or 1-methylimidazole in urine point towards the vasodilatory role of BNP.
PMC6112131	D03002	For instance, uridine can induce vasodilation by activation of purinergic P2Y receptors leading to release of nitric oxide, a well-known vasodilator.
PMC6112131	D03003	The metabolite GPC is an abundant osmolyte in renal medulla cells and was inversely associated with NT-proBNP in plasma.
PMC6112131	D03004	Similarly, betaine acts also as osmolyte and accumulates together with GPC, sorbitol, and inositol to sufficiently counterbalance osmolality.
PMC6112131	D03005	The inverse association of plasma GPC as well as urinary betaine with NT-proBNP appears to be a physiologic consequence of BNP signaling with respect to its role in diuresis.
PMC6112131	D03006	Despite controlling for kidney function by means of the eGFR as surrogate marker, two metabolites in urine previously reported as surrogates for glomerular filtration in plasma, namely pseudouridine and C-mannosyltryptophan, were positively associated with NT-proBNP in linear regression analyses.
PMC6112131	D03007	In previous work we identified urinary C-mannosyltryptophan as important predictor of an advanced inflammatory state in almost the same individuals as in the present investigation.
PMC6112131	D03008	In this context the positive association of NT-proBNP with urinary neopterin might be of particular interest.
PMC6112131	D03009	Neopterin belongs to the group of pteridines and is derived from guanosine triphosphate in activated monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and endothelial cells, but also to a lesser extent in renal epithelial cells.
PMC6112131	D03010	Typically, neopterin is considered a marker of enhanced immune activation.
PMC6112131	D03011	Neopterin in its unchanged form is excreted via the kidney and its levels correlate with the extent of disease or infection.
PMC6112131	D03012	In addition, Grammer et al. identified NT-proBNP and also the eGFR as strongest predictors for neopterin serum concentration linking neopterin to kidney function.
PMC6112131	D03013	Interestingly, also circulating adiponectin seems to be related with neopterin concentrations.
PMC6112131	D03014	Accordingly, a small observational study has observed that individuals with low HDL-cholesterol are characterized by low circulating adiponectin and high neopterin compared to individuals with high HDL-cholesterol
PMC6112131	D03015	This was interpreted as inflammatory phenotype in individuals with low HDL-cholesterol linking adiponectin also to inflammation.
PMC6112131	D03016	Estimation of the glomerular filtration rate using serum creatinine suffers from a number of drawbacks, e.g. difference in muscle mass affecting creatinine release, so we could not rule out residual confounding via capturing the true glomerular filtration rate of the participants.
PMC6112131	D03017	However, the metabolite signature comprising urine levels of pseudouridine, C-mannosyltryptophan and neopterin links serum NT-proBNP to impaired kidney function rather than cardiac dysfunction.
PMC6112131	D04002	It has been shown by Liang and coworkers in primary human adrenocortical cells, that BNP inhibited gene expression related to the angiotensin II induced steroidogenesis, including the de novo synthesis of cholesterol and other steps from cholesterol supply till steroid formation, namely cortisol, in mitochondria.
PMC6112131	D04003	In line with this, NT-proBNP associated urinary cortisol metabolites indicate a potential shift in cortisol metabolism favoring activation or diminished degradation, as 11-ketoetiocholanolone glucuronide and the unknown X-12844, recently identified as tetrahydrocortisone glucuronide, were inversely associated with NT-proBNP.
PMC6112131	D04004	In line with the described inhibition of BNP on angiotensin II induced steroidogenesis, the strong inverse association with NT-proBNP may be a consequence of affected cortisol synthesis.
PMC6112131	D04007	Thus, the observed associations with cortisol metabolites may implicate again that adiponectin may play a role in the observed associations.
PMC6112131	D04008	No association with plasma cortisol became obvious emphasizing local influence on cortisol metabolism as potential mechanism.
PMC6112131	D05002	In regard of the prominent role of skeletal muscle as well as adipose tissue in BCAA catabolism, starting with the conversion of BCAA into their respective α-keto acids within mitochondria, it might be conceivable that an inverse association of BCAA metabolites in urine with NT-proBNP is also related to BNP-signaling dependent increase in mitochondrial biogenesis.
PMC6112131	D05010	It has to be noted, that activation of brown adipose tissue by cold-exposure enhanced the triglyceride clearance from circulation, while HDL-cholesterol abundance increased and was sufficient to correct hyperlipidemia.
PMC6112131	M03005	Blood lipids (total cholesterol, high-density [HDL] and low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, triglycerides), serum enzymatic activity concentration of alanine amino transferase (ALT) and serum NT-proBNP were measured by standard methods (Dimension VISTA, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Eschborn, Germany).
PMC6112131	M03009	Serum creatinine was measured using an enzymatic assay (Dimension VISTA, Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Eschborn, Germany) and subsequently the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the CKD-EPI equation.
PMC6112131	M05004	Data on lipoprotein particles comprise 117 measures describing the gradient from very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles to HDL particles, including their triglycerides, cholesterol, free cholesterol, phospholipid as well as apolipoprotein B (ApoB), A1 (Apo-A1) and A2 (Apo-A2) content.
PMC6112131	R00001	However, women showed a more benficial lipid profile, mainly due to higher HDL-cholesterol values, compared to men.
PMC6112131	R00004	* χ_2 -test (nominal data) or Mann–Whitney-U test (interval data) were performed to compare men and women HDL high density lipoprotein, LDL low-density lipoprotein, NT-proBNP N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide, eGFR estimated glomerular filtration rate, ALT alanine aminotransferase, HF heart failure As no obvious sex-interactions (FDR < 0.2) were observed we did not stratify the analyses despite the strong differences in NT-proBNP concentrations between men and women.
PMC6112131	R01002	Even plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly inversely associated with NT-proBNP.
PMC6112131	R01007	The first column of each block contains the matrix, e.g., the specific particle, and the second column contains the analyte determined, e.g., the cholesterol content.
PMC6112131	R02001	Those included androsterone sulfate, glycerophosphocholine (GPC), the diacyl phosphatidylcholine (PC aa XX:Y) PC aaC40:5, the lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) C18:0, uridine and the two unknown compounds X-12844 and X-11444.
PMC6112131	R02005	Only C-mannosyltryptophan, 3-methylglutaconate, and 1-methylimidazoleacetate were an exception showing positive associations.
PMC6112131	R02006	Further inverse associations were observed for urinary levels of 11-ketoetiocholanolone glucuronide, glycolate, 1-methylxanthine, and methanol as well as several unknown compounds.
PMC6112131	R02009	Positive associations with serum NT-proBNP comprised neopterin, N -acetylneuraminate, pseudouridine, adenosine, phosphate, and acetone as well as several unknown compounds.
PMC6112131	R02014	By visual inspection of such a modified GGM we could integrate the unknown metabolites X-11444 and 12844, which were strongly associated with NT-proBNP in both fluids, together with 11-ketoetiocholanolone glucuronide into a steroid metabolite cascade (Fig. ).
PMC6112131	R03004	By visual inspection of such a modified GGM we could integrate the unknown metabolites X-11444 and 12844, which were strongly associated with NT-proBNP in both fluids, together with 11-ketoetiocholanolone glucuronide into a steroid metabolite cascade (Fig. ).
PMC6112131	R04005	The association with total cholesterol was not affected.
PMC6128478	A00000	To perform in vitro high-resolution 900 MHz magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) analysis of human brain tumor tissue extracts and analyze for the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) and other brain metabolites, not only for _1 H but also for _13 C with indirect detection by heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC).
PMC6128478	A01001	These tissue samples were extracted with 4% perchloric acid and chloroform, freeze-dried, then dissolved into 0.28 mL of deuterium oxide (D_2 O, 99.9 atom % deuterium) containing 0.025 wt % sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d _4 (TSP).
PMC6128478	A02000	2-hydroxyglutarate, an oncometabolite associated with gliomas with IDH mutations, was successfully detected and assigned by both _1 H-_13 C HSQC and _1 H-_1 H COSY experiments as well as _1 H 1D experiments in two of the tissue samples.
PMC6128478	A02001	In particular, to our knowledge this work shows the first example of detecting 900 MHz _13 C-NMR spectral lines of 2-hydroxyglutarate in human brain tumor tissue samples.
PMC6128478	A02002	In addition to the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, at least 42 more metabolites were identified from our series of NMR experiment.
PMC6128478	A03000	The detection of 2-hydroxyglutarate and other metabolites can be facilitated by homonuclear and heteronuclear two-dimensional 900 MHz NMR spectroscopy even in case of real tumor tissue sample extracts without physical separation of metabolites.
PMC6128478	M01004	The supernatant was transferred to a new tube where chloroform/tri-n-octylamine (78%/22%; v/v) was added in a 1:2 volumetric ratio to increase the pH to ~6.
PMC6128478	M02004	_1 H-_13 C HSQC experiments were performed with dwell time of 50.4 μs; at least 16 echo-antiecho pair acquisitions with 2048 data points for each increment in t _1 for each sample. _1 H-_13 C HMBC experiment for disodium (R /S )-2-hydroxyglutarate reference sample was also performed with experimental parameters similar to HSQC.
PMC6128478	R00000	_1 H 1D, _1 H-_13 C HSQC, _1 H-_1 H COSY and _1 H-_13 C HMBC spectra of disodium (R /S )-2-hydroxyglutarate in D_2 O were acquired for reference; only the HMBC spectrum is shown in .
PMC6128478	R00001	shows the assignment of all observable _1 H and _13 C peaks from 2-hydroxyglutarate.
PMC6128478	R01001	2-hydroxyglutarate was successfully detected and assigned by both _1 H-_13 C HSQC and _1 H-_1 H COSY experiments as well as _1 H 1D experiments.
PMC6128478	R01003	Of the 4 brain tumor tissue samples, 2 cases (e.g., sample#1 and 2 in ) had measurable 2HG concentrations (e.g., 1.74 and 2.62 mM) by NMR analysis and in each case, IDH1 (e.g. R132H) mutation was confirmed.
PMC6128478	R01004	In particular, to our knowledge this work shows the first example of detecting _13 C NMR spectral lines of 2-hydroxyglutarate in human brain tumor tissue samples.
PMC6128478	R01006	Even though only the (R )-form of the enantiomeric pairs of 2-hydroxyglutarate is known to be produced from the mutations in IDH1/2 [, , ], we did not attempt to differentiate between the enantiomeric pairs of 2-hydroxyglutarate in this work, although the use of chiral solvent may distinguish those enantiomeric pairs without diastereomeric derivatization or chiral separation.
PMC6128478	R01007	shows the _1 H-_13 C HSQC spectra of the two samples, one in which 2-hydroxyglutarate was detected and another sample in which 2-hydroxyglutarate was not detected.
PMC6128478	R01008	The cross peak arising from _2 CH(OH) was detected at δ_13 C = 74.9 ppm; in two dimensional expansion, this peak appeared close to but still distinct from the peak arising from _2 CH(OH) of myo -inositol.
PMC6128478	R01011	Given the similarities in molecular structures of glutamate, 4-aminobutyrate (GABA), and 2-hydroxyglutarate, it would be no surprise that the _4 CH_2 peaks from glutamate, _2 CH_2 peaks from GABA, and _4 CH_2 peaks from 2-hydroxyglutarate was detected close to one another even in _1 H-_13 C HSQC spectrum; however, the peaks from each metabolite were still distinguishable from one another.
PMC6128478	R01012	2-hydroxyglutarate was present in sample 2, as displayed in the lower spectra; the oncometabolite was absent in sample 4, as displayed in the upper spectra. _1 H-_1 H COSY experiments could further identify the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate even when other metabolites were also present, as is shown in .
PMC6128478	R01015	Since there are only a few metabolites that could show COSY cross peaks close to the cross peaks from 2-hydroxyglutarate as shown in inlet 2, detection of β–γ and β–β’ COSY cross peaks of 2-hydroxyglutarate would unambiguously identify the existence of this oncometabolite.
PMC6128478	R01016	Although 2-hydroxyglutaric acid could form cyclic lactone 5-oxo-2-tetrahydrofurancarboxylate in acidic condition, neither our reference sample nor our tissue samples showed peaks arising from cyclic lactone form.
PMC6128478	R01018	Baek et al . performed quantification of 2-hydroxyglutarate by _1 H 1D NMR using the TSP reference peak at 0 ppm as internal standard for quantification; the measured levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate had a range of 0.29–5.79 μmol/g.
PMC6128478	R01019	Recent solid-state MAS NMR study at 600 MHz spectrometer also reported 2-hydroxyglutarate levels of 0.1–11.2 mM for IDH1/2 mutation-positive brain tumor tissues.
PMC6128478	R01020	In vivo quantitation for human glioma patients performed with a 3 T human MRI scanner also reported concentration levels of 1.7–8.9 mM for the patients with 2-hydroxyglutarate detected.
PMC6128478	R01021	With mass spectrometry the concentrations of 2-hydroxyglutarate had been already measured and compared between R132H IDH1 mutation tumor cases and wild-type IDH1 tumor cases; the concentrations of 2-hydroxyglutarate in mutation-positive tumors were measured as 5–35 μmol/g, whereas tumors with wild-type IDH1 had over 100-fold less 2-hydroxyglutarate.
PMC6128478	R02000	In addition to the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, at least 42 more metabolites were identified from our series of NMR experiment.
PMC6128478	R02005	This difference might have arisen from the choice of chemical shift reference; both HMDB and Govindaraju’s employed 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate (DSS) for their reference, whereas Ye’s used TSP, the same as our choice of reference.
PMC6128478	R02013	For example, even though N -acetylaspartate (NAA) is known as one of the most abundant metabolites in human brain, this metabolite was virtually undetected in our experiment; it might have been converted to aspartate during extraction by perchloric acid.
PMC6128478	R02014	Glutathione is another metabolite that is relatively abundant in human brain but was not detected in our experiment; perhaps cystine (the oxidized disulfide form of the proteinogenic amino acid cysteine) might have been derived from glutathione during sample pretreatment.
PMC6128478	R02015	Although acetate is known to be relatively abundant in human brain, the _2 CH_3 peaks of acetate would completely overlap with _3 CH_2 peak of GABA in HSQC spectrum, so the chemical shift values of acetate is not separately listed in .
PMC6128478	R02019	As is already mentioned for acetate, the _3 CH_2 peak might overlap with the acetate _2 CH_3 peak.
PMC6128478	R02020	Being expected from molecular structures, the _4 CH_2 peak of GABA showed extensive overlap with _6 CH_2 peak of lysine, although GABA tends to be more abundant than lysine in typical human brain.
PMC6128478	R02021	For in vivo spectroscopy using medical MRI scanners, the prominent 3.2 ppm singlet from the trimethylammonium group of the cholinic species are universally observed and often used for diagnostic applications.
PMC6128478	R02022	In normal brain, the concentrations of phosphorylcholine and glycerophosphorylcholine are known as around 0.6 and 1.0 mmol/kg, respectively [, , ].
PMC6128478	R02023	The concentration of free choline is typically an order of magnitude smaller than the other two species, although significantly enhanced in case of tumors [, ].
PMC6128478	R02024	Although we could differentiate peaks from free choline, phosphorylcholine, and glycerophosphorylcholine in our HSQC spectra, the ratio among these three cholinic species might have been altered during the extraction process.
PMC6128478	R02026	The same consideration should be applied to glycerol, which is known to be below 0.1 mmol/kg in normal brain but might have been generated from the degradation of glycerophosphorylcholine during the pretreatment of the samples.
PMC6128478	R02027	Although the _2 CH and _3 CH_2 of homocysteine moiety of cystathionine and those of methionine gave almost identical peaks in HSQC, other peaks from respective metabolites suggested the presence of both metabolites.
PMC6128478	R02028	In COSY, both the homocysteine moiety of cystathionine and methionine gave _3 CH_2 –_4 CH_2 cross peaks at their respective positions.
PMC6128478	R02029	Cystathionine dominated, although methionine was also detected.
PMC6128478	R02030	Neither cysteine nor homocysteine was observed in its free form in our experiment.
PMC6128478	R02031	Cysteine was not observed in free form, but only in cystine form and in cystathionine form.
PMC6128478	R02032	Although glutathione is relatively abundant metabolite in human brain (~ 2 mmol/kg) and routinely observed in in vivo experiments, it was barely detected in our experiments.
PMC6128478	R02033	Again, this result might have come from the pretreatment of samples; cystine might have been generated in the course of sample pretreatment by the oxidative coupling of cysteine, or by the decomposition of glutathione, leaving only the disulfide backbone from glutathione.
PMC6128478	R02036	Further analysis for the identification of phosphorylated glucose was not performed.
PMC6128478	R02037	Being one of the most abundant metabolites in normal brain, myo -inositol
PMC6128478	R02038	((1R ,2R ,3S ,4S ,5R ,6S )-cyclohexane-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexol) could be readily observed and assigned in both HSQC and COSY experiments, although in COSY spectra the _1 CH-_2 CH (and _2 CH-_3 CH) cross peaks strongly overlapped with _1 CH_2 -_2 CH_2 cross peaks from choline.
PMC6128478	R02040	(3.35, 76.4) ppm observed in HSQC as the one arising from scyllo -inositol
PMC6128478	R02042	_6 CH_2 peak of lysine overlapped extensively with _4 CH_2 peak of GABA as well as _4 CH_2 peak of spermidine.
PMC6128478	R02043	In COSY, the _2 CH-_3 CH_2 cross peaks from lysine and arginine showed significant overlap with each other, although they were still distinguishable.
PMC6128478	R02046	Spermine and spermidine are naturally occurring polyamines.
PMC6128478	R02048	We detected and resolved both the symmetric spermine and asymmetric spermidine by HSQC and cross-checked by COSY.
PMC6128478	R02049	Although the _1 CH_2 and _2 CH_2 peaks from the putrescine moieties of spermine and spermidine were not distinguishable from each other, the _3 CH_2 and _4 CH_2 peaks from spermidine were separately identifiable.
PMC6128478	R02050	The positions of the HSQC cross peak of both spermine and spermidine showed excellent agreement with previously published data after adjusting chemical shift reference.
PMC6128478	R02051	Free putrescine might be present, but even in _1 H-_13 C HSQC the peak positions are almost identical to those of spermidine so that it could not be separately observed.
PMC6128478	R02052	The outermost _3 CH_2 peaks (the _3 CH_2 peaks from two 3-aminopropyl moieties in spermine and one in spermidine) appeared at almost identical position to the one from _β CH of phenylalanine in HSQC.
PMC6128478	R02053	Both taurine (2-aminoethanesulfonate) and hypotaurine (2-aminoethanesulfinate) were observed in all of our samples in HSQC and cross-checked in COSY spectra.
PMC6128478	R02054	Our assignment of taurine spectrum is consistent with HMDB, whereas the assignment by Govindaraju et al . seemed to need swapping the chemical shift assignment for _1 CH_2 and _2 CH_2 peaks, considering the _1 H and _13 C chemical shift ranges of CH_2 groups adjacent to sulfonate and amino groups.
PMC6128478	R02055	Uracil/uridine was the only nucleobase/ribonucleoside that could be observed and assigned in our NMR experiment.
PMC6128478	R02057	In HSQC the corresponding peak completely overlapped with _6 CH peak from the α-anomer of glucose.
PMC6128478	R02059	Cytidine might have been present but the ribose moieties of uridine and cytidine would give almost identical spectral lines in both _1 H and _13 C due to their similarity in molecular structures.
PMC6128478	R03000	Although acetate is known to be relatively abundant in human brain, the _2 CH_3 peaks of acetate would completely overlap with _3 CH_2 peak of GABA in HSQC spectrum, so the chemical shift values of acetate is not separately listed in .

PMC6133272	A01002	Current activity (at age 15y), mean activity across occasions, interaction by previous activity, and change in activity were examined in relation to systolic and diastolic blood pressure, insulin, C-reactive protein, and 230 traits from targeted metabolomics (nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy), including lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, amino and fatty acids, glycoprotein acetyls, and others, at age 15y.
PMC6133272	A01006	Current activity was most strongly associated with cholesterol and triglycerides in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles
PMC6133272	A01007	(e.g., −0.002 mmol/l or −0.18 SD units; 95% CI −0.24–−0.11 for triglycerides in chylomicrons and extremely large very low-density lipoprotein [XL VLDL]) and with glycoprotein acetyls (−0.02 mmol/l or −0.16 SD units; 95% CI −0.22–−0.10), among others.
PMC6133272	A01010	In mutually adjusted models, higher MVPA and sedentary time were oppositely associated with cholesterol and triglycerides in VLDL and HDL particles (MVPA more strongly with glycoprotein acetyls and sedentary time more strongly with amino acids).
PMC6133272	A04003	We found higher total activity to associate widely across metabolic traits including higher cholesterol in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles, lower cholesterol and triglycerides in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, and lower inflammatory glycoprotein acetyls, among others.
PMC6133272	D00002	Associations were strongest between higher-intensity activity and lower cholesterol in VLDL lipoprotein particles, higher cholesterol in HDL particles, lower triglyceride in both HDL and VLDL particles, and lower inflammatory glycoprotein acetyls, although association magnitude was generally small.
PMC6133272	D00006	In this study, higher current activity based on one accelerometry occasion and higher longer-term activity based on the mean of three separate accelerometry occasions were similarly associated with lower cholesterol in, and diameter of, VLDL particles; higher cholesterol in, and diameter of, HDL particles; lower triglycerides in VLDL and HDL particles; and with inflammatory traits, among others.
PMC6133272	D00007	Sedentary time was most associated with lower VLDL lipid fractions, lower cholesterol in small HDL particles, and several amino acids; associations were not directionally consistent with cholesterol and triglycerides across VLDL and LDL particles across sedentary time measures, however, suggesting these were less robust and more prone to confounding.
PMC6133272	D00014	That study pooled data from three cohorts of adults each with two occasions of self-reported activity and observed similar associations of higher activity with lower cholesterol in VLDL and remnant lipoproteins, higher cholesterol in HDL, lower triglycerides across all lipoproteins, and lower inflammatory glycoproteins, among others.
PMC6133272	D00015	Associations were generally stronger and effect sizes larger for most traits (at about 0.5 SD units) compared with our study, and higher activity was more strongly associated with lower cholesterol in LDL particles, whereas these were notably weak here.
PMC6133272	D00016	Whether associations with LDL cholesterol were underestimated here due to smaller sample size or were more realistically estimated due to enhanced activity measurement with accelerometry is unclear.
PMC6133272	D00020	Higher cholesterol content in LDL and remnant lipoproteins and higher total triglycerides are supported as causes of CHD through Mendelian randomisation studies [,] and randomised controlled trials [,].
PMC6133272	D00021	Lower HDL cholesterol is not supported as a cause of CHD by the same standard of evidence [,].
PMC6133272	D00022	In this study, both physical activity and sedentary time were more strongly associated with the concentration, diameter, and cholesterol content of HDL particles than of LDL particles.
PMC6133272	D00023	Higher activity was, however, also associated with cholesterol and triglyceride content in VLDL particles, a known LDL precursor.
PMC6133272	D00024	Together, this suggests that any protective effects of physical activity for CHD risk via lipid pathways likely operate through triglycerides and remnant cholesterol content, not LDL cholesterol itself.
PMC6133272	D00025	Higher activity was also associated with lower glycoprotein acetyls, which are inflammatory acute-phase reactants associated with future cardiovascular events and closely related to atherosclerotic inflammatory interleukins [,].
PMC6133272	D00029	Dependency of current activity on previous activity for metabolic trait associations have not been previously examined using device-measured activity, but numerous studies conducted on college alumni using historical activity from self-reported recall found little to no additional benefit of high previous activity (e.g., having been a college athlete) above current activity levels in relation to reduced LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and coronary heart disease risk [–].
PMC6133272	D02001	Activity was most strongly associated with cholesterol content in VLDL and HDL lipoprotein particles, with triglyceride content in all particle types, and with inflammatory glycoprotein acetyls.
PMC6133272	M03003	Proton NMR spectroscopy was performed as part of a targeted metabolomics platform to quantify 230 metabolic traits (150 concentrations plus 80 ratios) including the concentration and size of lipoproteins and their cholesterol and triglyceride content, lipid and glycaemic precursors including fatty acids and amino acids, inflammatory factors, and others.
PMC6133272	M04003	Alcohol consumption was estimated via questionnaire at age 15y and grouped as ‘never consumed’, ‘consumed once/twice or occasionally in the past’, ‘consumes less than weekly’, and ‘consumes at least once per week’.
PMC6133272	M06001	For example, total activity at 15y in relation to glycoprotein acetyls at 15y was examined with adjustment for glycoprotein acetyls at 8y.
PMC6133272	R02004	Higher total activity was associated with lower total VLDL cholesterol (−0.02 mmol/l or −0.13 SD units; 95% CI = −0.20, −0.07; P = 5.13 × 10_−5 ) and higher total HDL cholesterol (0.03 mmol/l or 0.13 SD units; 95% CI = 0.07, 0.20; P = 3.80 × 10_−5 ) but was unassociated with total LDL cholesterol (−0.007 mmol/l or −0.02 SD units; 95% CI = −0.09, 0.04; P = 0.44).
PMC6133272	R02006	Lower overall triglyceride concentrations were observed with higher total activity, as well as triglycerides within VLDL and HDL but not LDL particles.
PMC6133272	R02007	Strong associations were also observed with apolipoprotein B, with apolipoprotein B to A1 ratio, with omega 6 to total and polyunsaturated to total fatty acid ratios, and with glycoprotein acetyls.
PMC6133272	R02022	The strongest associations were observed with cholesterol and triglycerides in VLDL and HDL particles; with diameter of VLDL and HDL particles; and with apolipoproteins and glycoprotein acetyls.
PMC6133272	R02024	Sedentary time (per SD [66 min/d] higher) showed comparatively weaker associations with most traits; these had opposing directions of effect, particularly for cholesterol and triglycerides in VLDL and HDL particles (full results in ).
PMC6133272	R02027	Stronger associations were observed with amino acids (e.g., alanine at 0.01 mmol/l or 0.12 SD units; 95% CI = 0.05, 0.18; P = 7.32 × 10_−4 ).
PMC6133272	R02028	With adjustment for MVPA, effect size attenuation was substantial across VLDL-related traits but slight to nil for DBP, small HDL traits, and alanine.
PMC6133272	R03001	Effect sizes increased for several traits, particularly SBP (from −0.05 to −0.13 SD units), HDL particle concentrations and fractions, total VLDL, LDL, and HDL cholesterol, insulin (from −0.09 to −0.14 SD units), and inflammatory glycoprotein acetyls (from −0.16 to −0.20 SD units).
PMC6133272	R03003	For example, SBP attenuated from −0.13 to −0.08 SD units and glycoprotein acetyls from −0.20 to −0.11 SD units.
PMC6133272	R03005	Effect sizes increased for several traits including SBP (from −0.06 to −0.14 SD units), HDL-related traits, insulin (from −0.08 to −0.14 SD units), and glycoprotein acetyls (from −0.15 to −0.21 SD units).
PMC6133272	R03007	Sedentary time (per SD [50 min/d] higher based on 3 measures) appeared more strongly associated with most metabolic traits versus sedentary time based on a single measure, with several effect sizes having increased, particularly for small HDL-related traits, pyruvate (from 0.08 to 0.15 SD units), and alanine.
PMC6133272	R03008	Attenuations were slight to nil with adjustment for MVPA and for FMI, each based on 3 measures (e.g., from −0.23 to −0.21 to −0.20 SD units for total cholesterol in small HDL).
PMC6133272	R03009	The direction of effect size appeared to flip for cholesterol and triglycerides in VLDL and LDL particles, while the direction of effect remained consistently inverse with cholesterol and triglycerides in HDL particles, particularly medium and small HDL.
PMC6133272	R04004	Effect sizes were small but directionally concordant with those seen for current and longer-term MVPA measures in relation to cholesterol in VLDL and LDL particles and triglycerides across all particle types, while SBP and DBP appeared to flip their direction of effect.
PMC6133272	R04005	Cholesterol in HDL particles appeared most unassociated, in contrast to previous MVPA measures (current and longer term).
PMC6133272	R04006	Increased sedentary time was largely unassociated with cholesterol and triglycerides across all particle types, while stronger evidence of association was observed for the amino acids phenylalanine (−0.001 mmol/l or −0.09 SD units; 95% CI = −0.15, −0.03; P = 0.003) and tyrosine (−0.001 mmol/l or −0.06 SD units; 95% CI = −0.12, 0.00; P = 0.05).
PMC6133272	R05001	For example, the pre-adjusted association estimate of higher total activity with lower triglycerides in VLDL particles at age 15y (−0.03 mmol/l or −0.12 SD units; 95% CI = −0.18, −0.06; P = 1.06 × 10_−4 ) was essentially unchanged after adjusting for triglycerides in VLDL particles at age 8y (−0.11 SD units; 95% CI = −0.17, −0.04; P = 1.36 × 10_−3 ).

PMC6133922	D00009	The latter study reported dose-specific effects of a longer supplementation phase (one menstrual cycle vs . 5 days) in a different study population, treated with different sources of isoflavones (soy supplements vs . soymilk).
PMC6133922	D00019	Also, top KEGG pathway analysis results exhibit some pathways that have a known association to breast and other cancers such as mTOR, Oxytocine, MAPK, AGE-RAGE signaling pathways.
PMC6133922	D00024	Early-life exposure to soy may alter estrogen mediated processes and therefore, alter the effect of genistein, daidzein and other isoflavones, which are estrogen antagonists.
PMC6133922	M00006	One portion of soymilk (250 mL) contained 16.98 ± 0.76 mg genistein and 5.40 ± 0.22 mg daidzein aglycone equivalents, and 8.25 g proteins, 7 g carbohydrates, 4.75 g lipids, 1.5 g fibers, 0.375 µg vitamin B12, 0.6 µg vitamin B2, and minerals.
PMC6133922	M01007	Compliance was evaluated by subject inquiry and urinary isoflavone excretion.
PMC6133922	M02000	Genistein, daidzein, and equol were purchased from Extrasynthèse (Genay, France), and dihydrodaidzein and O -desmethylangolensin from Plantech UK (Reading, UK).

PMC6133922	M02003	A 400 µmol/L and 40 µmol/L-solution of 4-hydroxybenzophenone in methanol was used as internal standard in the quantitative analyses of urine, serum, and breast tissue, respectively.
PMC6133922	M03000	Genistein, daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, equol, and O -desmethylangolensin in urine were quantified upon enzymatic hydrolysis and liquid-liquid extraction, using a LC-MS method validated by Wyns et al ..
PMC6133922	M03001	Based on a creatinine clearance rate of 0.163 mmol/(d.kg), daily urinary isoflavone excretions were calculated.
PMC6133922	M03002	Quantification of genistein, daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, equol, O -desmethylangolensin, and the internal standard in hydrolyzed serum (200 µL) and glandular tissue (250 mg) was performed by LC-MS/MS according to Bolca et al ..
PMC6133922	M03003	Additionally, estrogens were extracted from glandular breast tissue (200 mg) as described by Chetrite et al . and analyzed for 17β-estradiol using a quantitative immunoassay (EIA-4499, DRG Instruments GmbH, Marburg, Germany).
PMC6133922	M05002	In summary, gDNA was enzymatically hydrolyzed to deoxyribonucleosides and dissolved in LC-grade water.
PMC6133922	M05003	Similarly, stock solutions were prepared for reference standards of 2′-deoxycytidine (dC) and 5-methyl-2′-deoxycytidine (5-mdC), purchased from Sigma (D3897-1G) and Jena Bioscience (N-1044) respectively, to create a series of calibration standards, used in all of the experiments.
PMC6133922	M05004	Global DNA methylation was assessed by quantifying both 5-mdC and dC using Waters Acquity UPLC coupled to Waters Micromass
PMC6133922	M05006	Global DNA methylation was calculated as a percentage of 5-mdC versus the sum of 5-mdC and dC.
PMC6133922	M06000	For MethylCap-seq, sequence reads were mapped to the human reference genome (GRCh37) with BOWTIE and aligned fragments were summarized using the in-house developed Map of the Human Methylome (http://www.biobix.be/map-of-the-human-methylome/).
PMC6133922	M06026	Additional data analyses were performed in R (3.3.2) as well: the Student t -test was used to compare sequencing characteristics, LINE-1 methylation, and global DNA methylation between groups, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for the comparison of 17β-estradiol concentration and both genic-intergenic and promoter-genic methylation ratios between treatment groups, and Spearman correlation to evaluate the correlation between isoflavone concentrations and library sizes resp. locus-specific methylation degrees.
PMC6133922	R00007	With regard to past and present isoflavone intakes, the study population consisted of mostly non-consumers (80%), with only 2 subjects consuming soy-derived products on a daily-to-weekly basis (soymilk: 1; control: 1).
PMC6133922	R01000	Exposure to genistein, daidzein, and its microbial metabolites upon soy supplementation, was assessed as the sum of unconjugated aglycones and deconjugated (sulfo)glucuronides and sulfates, measured in hydrolyzed urine, serum, and glandular breast tissue.
PMC6133922	R01001	None of the urine samples collected at the end of the run-in phase after the intervention phase for the control group contained detectable amounts of isoflavones, whereas the estimated daily urinary isoflavone excretion confirmed compliance to the soymilk diet in the treatment group (genistein: 6.6–13,140.0 µmol/day; daidzein: 2.4–2,025.0 µmol/day; individual data not shown).
PMC6133922	R01002	Genistein and total daidzein (i .e .
PMC6133922	R01003	, sum of daidzein, dihydrodaidzein, O- desmethylangolensin, and equol) serum concentrations ranged from 246.4 to 2,831 nmol/L and from 105.1 to 1,314 nmol/L upon treatment, respectively.
PMC6133922	R01004	In breast glandular tissue, exposure levels of 114.0–493.8 pmol/g genistein, of 22.2–666.0 pmol/g total daidzein, and of 0.021–1.489 pmol/g 17β-estradiol were measured.
PMC6133922	R01005	17β-estradiol was not significantly different between soymilk and control groups (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, P  = 0.74).
PMC6133922	R02012	These analyses were based on (i) independent measurement of methylation degree (by LC-MS) on a subset of the population under study, (ii) an evaluation of the association between the MethylCap sequencing characteristics and measured soy metabolite concentrations in the tissue for the soy-exposed group only, (iii) evaluation of LINE-1 methylation (proxy for global methylation) shifts associated with soy exposure in the MethylCap-seq data (full population).
PMC6133922	R02015	Next, if sequencing characteristics differ due to soy supplementation, one would expect that these parameters are also correlated with the in vivo concentrations of soy metabolites (genistein, total daidzein and total isoflavones) in soy treated individuals.
PMC6133922	R02016	However, Spearman correlation revealed no borderline or significant associations between MethylCap-seq library size and respectively genistein (ρ = 0.47, P  = 0.18), total daidzein (ρ = 0.03, P  = 0.95), and total isoflavone (ρ = 0.37, P  = 0.30) tissue concentrations in those subjects exposed to soy.
PMC6133922	R02017	Additionally, the correlations are all positive, opposite of what would be anticipated if soy supplementation would lead to global hypomethylation (i.e. lower library sizes with higher isoflavone concentrations).

PMC6150202	M00008	A 10 mM ammonium acetate adjusted at pH 9 by 3% (v/v ) ammonium hydroxide and including a 5% (v/v ) methanol addition was used as an optimum background electrolyte (BGE).
PMC6150202	M00015	The optimum composition of the sheath liquid was 50% (v/v ) methanol/water with an addition of 5 mM ammonium acetate (compromising a maximum intensity and reproducibility of the detection response for the drugs).
PMC6150202	M01000	The CE electrolyte solution was prepared from ammonium acetate adjusted to pH 9.0 by 3% (v/v ) ammonium hydroxide and with an addition of 5% (v/v ) methanol; all chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich, Steinheim, Germany).

PMC6150202	M02002	It was found out in our previous work that the presence of a 20% methanol in the samples improved the peak shape (avoiding a peak tailing) and, by that, improved the separation efficiency.
PMC6150202	M02004	The six concentration levels of the drugs in the injected model urine calibration solutions, prepared by spiking 10-fold diluted blank urine, were in the range of 0.5–15 μg·mL_−1 and 0.25–15 μg·mL_−1 for prednisone and the other studied drugs, respectively.
PMC6150202	M02007	Quality control samples (QCs) at three concentration levels (0.5, 2.5, and 10 μg·mL_−1 and 0.25, 2.5 and 10 μg·mL_−1 for prednisone and the other drugs, respectively), were prepared in 10-fold diluted blank human urine.

PMC6150202	R02007	The MRM profiles with the selected quantifier signals, and the fact that there were no significant interfering peaks in the selected transitions, were favorable for the sensitive and reliable determination of the AZA and its metabolites, 6-MP, 6-MMP, and co-medicated drug MSL, in the clinical urine samples.
PMC6150202	R02011	The developed CE-MS/MS method was successfully used to control patient compliance with thiopurine medication and relevant co-medication.
PMC6150202	R02013	Although it was less pronounced/consistent for the co-medicated MSL, probably because of higher variability in the creation of N -acetyl-mesalazine as its main metabolite (standard was not available, e.g., to confirm the peak eluting in 8.5 min in the right MSL panel in ), it was still sufficient for the reliable monitoring of MSL eliminated in urine after its peroral administration.
PMC6150202	R02015	MRM transitions from CE-ESI-MS/MS analysis of 10-fold diluted human urine sample were obtained from the patients treated by azathioprine with a daily dosage of 50 mg (left panel) and 100 mg (right panel), and a mesalazine co-medication.
PMC6150202	R02017	Thiopurine S -methyltransferase (TPMT) plays an important role in the metabolism of thiopurines used in IBD therapy, i.e., in keeping balance between active (non-methylated) and non-active (methylated) thiopurine metabolites.
PMC6150202	R02020	A great advantage of such monitoring is (i) its complexity (we can correlate an amount of the original drug AZA with its active, 6-MP, and inactive, 6-MMP, metabolites) and (ii) its non-invasive character (replacing blood for urine samples).

PMC6170707	D00010	There are no direct data in animals on the effect of DES on estrogen metabolism.
PMC6170707	D00011	Data on the effect of prenatal DES exposure on hormone concentrations in humans are scant.
PMC6170707	D00012	Two small studies of DES and hormones_, were conducted in the 1970s with inconsistent results and using hormone assay methods far inferior to those now available.
PMC6170707	D00013	More recently, data from a small sample of premenopausal women in the Harvard Study of Moods and Cycles showed that those who reported prenatal DES exposure had lower estradiol concentrations than those who did not report DES exposure.
PMC6170707	D00014	In the absence of medical record confirmation, DES exposure status is likely to be misclassified, although the magnitude of the effect of this on previous study findings is unknown.
PMC6170707	D00015	In our study, which includes confirmation of DES exposure status for all participants, results suggest that parent estrogen concentrations, including estradiol, are somewhat greater in DES exposed postmenopausal women.
PMC6170707	D00017	The women who were included were likely exposed to a high cumulative dose of DES in utero , and the majority had VEC, which is associated with high DES dose and early exposure in pregnancy.
PMC6170707	D00019	Nonetheless, it demonstrated a pattern of results consistent with a relative decrease in levels of 2-hydroxylation pathway metabolites and in the ratio of these to total parent estrogens and to 16-hydroxylation pathway metabolites in the prenatally DES exposed compared with unexposed women.
PMC6170707	D00021	While the association between DES and estrogen metabolism is in the direction of higher breast cancer risk for the prenatally DES exposed and could therefore possibly explain some of their modestly increased risk compared with the unexposed, it will take a larger study to quantify the magnitude of the effect.
PMC6170707	D00022	Because the number of participants studied was small, we tried to account only for the major influences on estrogen metabolism.
PMC6170707	D00023	We did not collect information on dietary intake or physical activity, and we think it unlikely that there would be a strong association between these factors and whether the participant’s mother took DES during the daughter’s pregnancy.
PMC6170707	D00024	Our hypothesis was that prenatal exposure to DES effects estrogen metabolism and that alterations in estrogen metabolism persist after menopause.
PMC6170707	D00025	Because we believe DES’ effects on estrogen metabolism would occur prenatally and therefore precede the adverse reproductive events we have chronicled, we did not adjust for those intervening events in the analyses of DES exposure and estrogen metabolism.
PMC6170707	D00028	Our preliminary findings suggest that prenatal exposure to endocrine disruptors may influence estrogen metabolism many years later.
PMC6170707	M00000	The data for the current analysis were collected as part of a feasibility study at Boston University, one of five sites of the NCI Combined DES Cohort Follow-up Study.
PMC6170707	M01000	In 1992, the NCI assembled extant U.S. cohorts of individuals with medical record documentation of exposure or lack of exposure to DES, including daughters identified from the National Cooperative Diethylstilbestrol Adenosis Project (DESAD), and a large private infertility practice in Massachusetts.
PMC6170707	M02006	We also attempted to choose women with vaginal epithelial changes (VEC), which are correlated with a higher dose of, and earlier exposure to, DES in utero.
PMC6170707	M03000	A validated and reported stable isotope dilution high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) assay was employed to measure 15 estrogens and estrogen metabolites, including estrone, estradiol, 2-hydroxyestrone, 2-methoxyestrone, 2-hydroxyestradiol, 2-methoxyestradiol, 2-hydroxyestrone-3-methyl ether, 4-hydroxyestrone, 4-methoxyestrone, 4-methoxyestradiol, 16α-hydroxyestrone, 16-ketoestradiol, estriol, 17-epiestriol, and 16-epiestriol, in serum as previously described_, with updated instrumentations and additional stable isotope labeled estrogen metabolites.
PMC6170707	M03003	Twelve stable isotopically labeled estrogens and estrogen metabolites were used to account for losses during sample preparation and HPLC-MS/MS analyses, which included deuterated estriol, (C/D/N Isotopes, Inc., Pointe-Claire, Quebec, Canada); deuterated 16-epiestriol (Medical Isotopes, Inc., Pelham, NH); and 13C-labeled estrone, estradiol, 2-hydroxyestrone, 2-methoxyestrone, 2-hydroxyestradiol, 2-methoxyestradiol, 2-hydroxyestrone-3-methyl ether, 4-hydroxyestrone, 4-methoxyestrone, and 4-methoxyestradiol (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover, MA).
PMC6170707	M03005	The stable isotope dilution HPLC-MS/MS was used to quantify 15 estrogens and estrogen metabolites that circulate primarily as sulfated and/or glucuronidated conjugates.
PMC6170707	M03006	Five (estrone, estradiol, estriol, 2-methoxyestrone, and 2-methoxyestradiol) were measured in unconjugated forms.
PMC6170707	M03008	To measure the combined parent estrogen or estrogen metabolite level, an enzymatic hydrolysis with sulfatase and glucuronidase activity was added to the sample preparation to cleave any sulfate and glucuronide groups.
PMC6170707	M03010	For metabolites with both combined and unconjugated measurements, the concentration of the conjugated form was calculated as the difference between the combined and unconjugated estrogen measurements.
PMC6170707	M03011	The Calibration curves were linear over a concentration range of 1 pg/mL to 1000 pg/mL for all estrogens and estrogen metabolites.
PMC6170707	M03012	The assay limit of detection (LOD) providing estrogen signal-to-noise ratio greater than 3-to-1 was 100 fg/mL (approximately 0.33–0.37 pmol/L).
PMC6170707	M03013	The assay lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 1 pg/mL for each estrogen and estrogen metabolite with intra-and inter-batch coefficients of variation <15% and assay accuracy between 85–115% of known targeted values at LLOQ.
PMC6170707	M03015	Estrogens and estrogen metabolites were analyzed individually, in groups representing metabolic pathways, and as ratios of metabolic pathways.
PMC6170707	M03016	Estrone and estradiol, the parent estrogens, are irreversibly hydroxylated at the C-2, C-4, or C-16 positions of the steroid ring, leading to a cascade of metabolites.
PMC6170707	M03017	The combined metabolites in each of the C-2, C-4 and C-16 pathways were used to investigate whether prenatal DES exposure was associated with altered patterns of estrogen metabolism.
PMC6170707	M03018	These included metabolites in the 2-hydroxylation pathway (Path2, i.e., 2-hydroxyestrone, 2-methoxyestrone, 2-hydroxyestradiol, 2-methoxyestradiol, and 2-hydroxyestrone-3-methyl ether); metabolites in the 4-hydroxylation pathway (Path4, i.e., 4-hydroxyestrone, 4-methoxyestrone, and 4-methoxyestradiol); and metabolites in the 16-hydroxylation pathway (Path16, i.e., 16α-hydroxyestrone, estriol, 17-epiestriol, 16-ketoestradiol, and 16-epiestriol).
PMC6170707	M03020	Total parent estrogens were the sum of estrone and estradiol; total metabolites were the sum of Path2, Path4 and Path16; and total estrogens was defined as the sum of the parent estrogens and metabolites.
PMC6170707	M04000	Values for the estrogens were examined for outliers and those with 1.5 interquartile ranges above the 75% percentile or below the 25% percentile were excluded for the analysis of that estrogen..
PMC6170707	M04003	Standard linear models (Proc GLM; SAS) with log-estrogen (or log-ratio) as the dependent variable and DES status as the independent variable evaluated the effect of DES exposure.
PMC6170707	M04005	The coefficient, β, for DES was exponentiated and estimates the ratio of the geometric means between the two groups.
PMC6170707	M04007	A positive percent change indicates that the mean is higher in the DES exposed compared with the unexposed, and a negative % change indicates that the mean is lower in the exposed compared with the unexposed.
PMC6170707	M04008	The reported age-adjusted geometric means for each of the DES groups were estimated using the least-square means procedure (lsmeans statement) in SAS.
PMC6170707	R00005	Characteristics of Participants by Prenatal DES Exposure.
PMC6170707	R00007	In the exposed and unexposed combined, parent estrogens, Path2, Path4, and Path16 metabolites comprised 38.3% (estrone 34.6%, estradiol 3.7%), 16.3%, 1.7%, and 43.6% of total estrogens (sum of all 15 concentrations), respectively.
PMC6170707	R00008	The parent hormones, estrone and estradiol, were highly correlated (r=0.84), whereas the other metabolites showed less correlation.
PMC6170707	R00009	Age-adjusted geometric mean serum concentrations of the parent estrogens and estrogen metabolites by prenatal DES exposure are presented in .
PMC6170707	R00010	In general, total estrogens and parent estrogens were greater in the DES exposed women.
PMC6170707	R00011	The ratios of path2:total estrogens, path2:parent estrogens, and path2:path16 (i.e. less metabolism in the 2 vs. 16 pathway) were all lower in the DES exposed women, while the ratio of path16:total metabolites was greater in the DES exposed.

PMC6189193	A00007	Because acetate is the major bioenergetic fuel for support of mitochondrial respiration, deficient acetylated species in CSF suggests a brain energy defect that may drive neurodegeneration.
PMC6189193	D00011	As shown for Levetiracetam (Supplementary Fig.
PMC6189193	D00014	To that end we performed a correlation analysis of the biomarkers with Levetiracetam and its co-dependent metabolite features for those CLN2 cases that obtained this particular drug.
PMC6189193	D00017	In case of Levetiracetam, this possibility could be ruled out by the validation set, in which only one CLN2 case received this drug.
PMC6189193	D00018	The other antiepileptic drugs of the CLN2 disease cases, e.g. Valproic acid, Clonazepam and Clobazam, have different modes of action, which suggests that the changes in the CSF-metabolite profile would be different for each drug.
PMC6189193	D00025	Notably, all identified CLN2 disease biomarkers in CSF, except glycerol-3-phosphoinositol, are acetylated species.
PMC6189193	D00027	As acetate is the major cellular fuel, derived from both carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, the observed reduction of acetylated species in CSF raises the possibility of a disease-associated energetic deficit in neurons and/or glial cells.
PMC6189193	D00029	As a potential contributor to this bioenergetic defect, it is notable that TPP1 was shown to function as an exopeptidase in the sedolisin family, serving to cleave tripeptides from unsubstituted N-termini of specific neuropeptides, including subunit C of mitochondrial ATP synthase.
PMC6189193	D00032	As the disease severity strongly correlates with the observed acetylated metabolites, it is conceivable that N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, N-acetylalanine, N-acetylserine and N-acetylthreonine arise predominantly as downstream metabolites of the cleavage process initiated by TPP1.
PMC6189193	D00034	N-acetylaspartyglutamic acid (NAAG), the most abundant excitatory peptide neurotransmitter in the CNS, activates mGlu3 receptors and consequently inhibits the release of glutamate into the synaptic cleft.
PMC6189193	D00036	NAAG is hydrolyzed by glutamate carboxypeptidase II into N-acetylaspartate and N-acetylglutamate
PMC6189193	D00037	In contrast to a reduction in NAAG, the concentration of its downstream metabolite N-acetylaspartic acid (NAA) was not significantly changed in the CSF, whereas Worgall et al .
PMC6189193	D00039	Interestingly, glutamic acid was observed to be slightly, but significantly (p < 0.05), reduced in the CLN2 disease subjects’ CSF in both the test and validation cohort cohorts.
PMC6189193	D00040	To our knowledge, the current literature only describes elevated levels of NAAG in Canavan disease, arising from a deficiency in aminoacylase 2, the enzyme principally responsible for the breakdown of N-acetylaspartate.
PMC6189193	D00041	Patients with free sialic acid storage disease (Salla disease), another recognized lysosomal storage defect, also exhibit increased CSF levels of NAAG and N-acetylneuraminic acid.
PMC6189193	D00042	Additionally, low levels of NAAG in brain tissue and increased levels in CSF are associated with human amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).
PMC6189193	D00044	The cause of reduced NAAG levels await specification.
PMC6189193	D00045	However, since a combined reduction in levels of NAAG, N-acetylalanine, N-acetylthreonine and N-acetylserine hasn’t been previously recognized as associated with any inborn error of metabolism, we speculate that this pattern of change can serve as a unique identifier of CLN2 disease.
PMC6189193	D00046	Levels of N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) are known to be highest in the brain, associated with sialylated glycolipids (gangliosides).
PMC6189193	D00047	Polysialic acid was shown to be important in neuronal sprouting and plasticity.
PMC6189193	D00048	Accordingly, low CSF levels of N-acetylneuraminic acid and its dimer in CLN2 disease cases may contribute to neurodevelopmental delay and the neuroregression of afflicted patients.
PMC6189193	D00049	In addition to acetylated species, sulfoacetic acid was found to be significantly diminished in CSF from CLN2 disease cases, with levels that correlate inversely with disease severity.
PMC6189193	D00050	A slight reduction in taurine level is concomitant, but not correlating with the disease severity, suggesting that the taurine pathway in neuronal cells of CLN2 disease cases may be perturbed.
PMC6189193	D00051	For drug-naïve patients with schizophrenic disorders, a reduction of CSF taurine has previously been described.
PMC6189193	D00053	In summary, a NAAG reduction in CSF combined with lower levels of N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid dimer, N-acetylalanine, N-acetylserine and N-acetylthreonine as well as glycero-3-phosphoinositol and sulfoacetic acid, have not been detected in any other disease and thus offer a unique biomarker signature for CLN2 disease diagnosis and prognosis.
PMC6189193	M01000	LC-MS grade acetonitrile (ACN), isopropanol (IPA) and methanol (MeOH) were purchased from Fisher Scientific.
PMC6189193	M01002	OmniTrace glacial acetic acid and ammonium hydroxide were obtained from EMD Chemicals.
PMC6189193	M01003	Glycero-3-phosphoinositol was purchased from Echelon Biosciences Inc., N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, ammonium acetate and all other chemicals and standards were purchased from Sigma Aldrich in the best available grade.
PMC6189193	M02000	CSF metabolites were extracted by addition of 1 part CSF to 9 parts iced (vol:vol) 70% acetonitrile in 30% ddH_2 O, containing 0.2% ammonium hydroxide.
PMC6189193	M03002	The mobile phases consisted of: (A) 50% isopropanol, containing 0.025% acetic acid, and (B) 90% acetonitrile with 5 mM ammonium acetate.
PMC6189193	R01006	Notably, pyruvate, isoleucine, homocitric acid and N-acetylneuraminic were found to be 1.6–2.3-fold decreased in the CLN2 disease group vs. control (Supplementary Table _S3 ).
PMC6189193	R02003	Initial MS/MS fragmentation suggested the drug Levetiracetam as the origin of 14 out of those 26 metabolites (Supplementary Fig.
PMC6189193	R02005	Disclosure of the medical history of the CLN2 subjects confirmed that Levetiracetam and also Clonazepam was administered to >60% of the CLN2 disease individuals.
PMC6189193	R02015	A METLIN MS/MS database search suggested N-acetylaspartyl glutamate as the identity of Unknown 1, glycero-3-phosphoinositol as Unknown 2, methansulfonic acid as Unknown 4 whereas Unknowns 3, 5 and 6 initially remained unidentified.
PMC6189193	R02017	_a METLIN database search yielded a variety of possibilities for Unknown 5, e.g. aminolevulinic acid and cis/trans-4-hydroxyproline, which could be excluded by mismatching retention time to the in-house database entry.

PMC6189193	R04000	MS/MS fragmentation experiments with pure reference standards for N-acetylaspartyl glutamate and glycerol-3-phosphoinositol, confirmed the identities of Unknown 1 and Unknown 2 (Supplementary Figs _S2 and _3 ).
PMC6189193	R04001	MS/MS fragmentation of Unknown 3 resulted in a fragment that had the same m/z as N-acetylneuraminic acid, which initially was found to differentiate CLN2 subjects from normal individuals (Supplementary Table _S3 ).
PMC6189193	R04002	Unknown 3 could be attributed to N-acetylneuraminic acid dimer and confirmed by an MS/MS spectral match to a reference standard (Supplementary Fig.
PMC6189193	R04004	The identity of Unknown 4 was suggested to be methansulfonic acid.
PMC6189193	R04007	A METLIN MS/MS database search resulted in the assignment of sulfoacetic acid as the parent metabolite for Unknown 4.
PMC6189193	R04008	Notably, in the original MRIDSS correlation analysis, sulfoacetic acid didn’t meet the p-value cutoff for significance of < 0.05 with an actual p-value of 0.0503.
PMC6189193	R04009	Unknown 5 was identified as N-acetylalanine by chromatographic retention time and MS/MS fragmentation match with a pure reference standard (Supplementary Fig.
PMC6189193	R05002	Targeted data remining of the acquired data for yet unidentified acetylated amino acids revealed levels of N-acetylserine and N-acetylthreonine to also be significantly attenuated in the CLN2 disease group, versus control (Supplementary Fig.
PMC6189193	R05004	The identity of N-acetylserine was confidently confirmed by both chromatographic retention time and MS/MS spectra of a representative case extract and a reference standard.
PMC6189193	R06004	Notably, N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid (and its adduct), glycero-3-phosphoinositol, N-actylneuraminic acid dimer, N-acetylalanine, sulfoacetic acid (characterized by its accurate mass 139.981 Da and its in-source fragment 95.988), N-acetylthreonine and N-acetylserine all significantly correlated with MRIDSS as well as with the WCLS scores.
PMC6189193	R06005	In contrast, N-acetylglycine and N-acetylglutamic acid did not exhibit a linear correlation with disease severity (Fig.
PMC6189193	R06015	Significant negative correlations of the CLN2 disease severity biomarkers and age were obtained for N-acetylaspartylglutamic acid, glycerol-3-phosphoinositol, N-acetylneuraminic acid, N-acetylneuraminic acid dimer, N-acetylalanine, N-acetylserine and N-acetylthreonine.
PMC6189193	R06017	Interestingly, for N-acetylneuraminic acid dimer and N-acetylglycine positive and thus opposite correlations with the age of the control subjects were obtained.
PMC6194742	D01004	However, ID 6054 had fragments characteristic of [C_16 H_29 O_2 ]_− and losses of two H_2 O molecules, consistent with the loss of two hydroxyl groups and a hexadecenoic acetate fragment.
PMC6194742	D01005	These fragments are suggestive of ceramide lipids, a class of molecules that has been implicated in the regulation of cancer cells.

PMC6194742	M01000	Isopropanol (LC-MS grade, Fluka), methanol, water and _13 C- cholic acid (internal standard) were from Sigma-Aldrich (Milwaukee, WI, USA).
PMC6194742	M01001	Acetic acid (LC-MS grade, Optima) and chloroform were from Fisher Scientific (Santa Clara, CA, USA).
PMC6194742	M02002	As previously reported, 20 μl of serum was mixed with 100 μl of a solvent mixture (isopropanol/methanol/water = 60:35:5) containing _13 C -cholic acid as an internal standard (final concentration of 3.0 μg/ml).
PMC6224486	A00006	The metabolite panel including dopamine 4-sulfate, MG00/1846Z,9Z,12Z,15Z/00, aspartyl-histidine, and tyrosyl-methionine was found in a discovery set, which showed the predictive ability to distinguish the NMIBC group from the control group with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.838 in an external validation set.
PMC6224486	A00007	The AUC of the panel for low-grade NMIBC samples, which consisted of 3-hydroxy-cis-5-tetradecenoylcarnitine, 6-ketoestriol, beta-cortolone, tetrahydrocorticosterone, and heptylmalonic acid, was 0.899.
PMC6224486	A00010	In addition, metabolites involved in tryptophan metabolism were upregulated in the urine of high-grade NMIBC patients when compared with low-grade NMIBC patients with the presence or absence of hematuria.
PMC6224486	D01001	The hypothesis considers the facilitation of tumor initiation by dysregulation of lipid metabolism and the increased utilization of glucose for energy as the hallmarks of many proliferating tumors.
PMC6224486	D01003	Dopamine 4-sulfate, a metabolite of endogenous dopamine, was one of the metabolites in the panel.
PMC6224486	D01004	It has been reported that dopamine influences the behavior of tumor, including ovarian carcinoma, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer, by inhibiting cell proliferation.
PMC6224486	D01005	Thus, the metabolism of dopamine can be increased in cancer, and this has been reported in neuroblastoma and Wilms' tumors.
PMC6224486	D01006	Our study is the first to report high levels of metabolism of dopamine in NMIBC apart from bladder pheochromocytoma.
PMC6224486	D01007	MG00/1846Z,9Z,12Z,15Z/00, another metabolite in the panel, is a monoacylglyceride that can be broken down by monoacylglycerol lipase.
PMC6224486	D01008	In the present study, the level of monoacylglyceride was low probably due to the high level of monoacylglycerol lipase, which has been shown to promote hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer (, ).
PMC6224486	D01011	We measured lower levels of avocadyne 4-acetate and 1-acetoxy-2-hydroxy-16-heptadecen-4-one in the urine from patients with NMIBC than in the urine from healthy controls.
PMC6224486	D02001	The significantly differential metabolites included undecanoylcarnitine, 3-hydroxytetradecanoyl carnitine, 3-hydroxy-5, 8-tetradecadiencarnitine, 3-hydroxy-cis-5-tetradecenoylcarnitine, and O-decanoyl-L-carnitine; the levels of these compounds were decreased in the low-grade NMIBC group without the elevation of any other carnitines.
PMC6224486	D02002	Since carnitine and its short-chain derivatives are essential for the entry of fatty acid into mitochondria for oxidation, fatty acid oxidation is decreased in the low-grade NMIBC group compared to the controls.
PMC6224486	D02003	Moreover, acetyl-carnitine provides a source of acetyl groups for nuclear protein acetylation by histone acetyl-transferases.
PMC6224486	D02005	Additionally, Pisano et al. also demonstrated that acetyl-carnitine had a direct anti-tumor effect through the potentiation of platinum-based therapy.
PMC6224486	D02006	In our study, the level of undecanoylcarnitine, a member of acetyl-carnitine family, was decreased in the low-grade NMIBC group compared to the control group.
PMC6224486	D02007	Myristic acid, an exogenous saturated fatty acid that originates from dietary uptake and is involved in the biological process of energy production (, ), was increased in the urine of the low-grade NMIBC patients, further illustrating the lowered level of fatty acid oxidation in the low-grade NMIBC samples vs. the controls.
PMC6224486	D02008	Moreover, exogenous myristic acid can increase the biosynthesis of myristoyl CoA and myristoylated Src and promote Src kinase-mediated oncogenic signaling in the human cells.
PMC6224486	D02011	High levels of L-3-hydroxykynurenine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde were observed in high-grade NMIBC with hematuria; both metabolites are associated with tryptophan metabolism.
PMC6224486	D02012	Furthermore, L-3-hydroxykynurenine is a metabolite in the kynurenine pathway, the major route of tryptophan metabolism.
PMC6224486	D02013	Increased concentrations of kynureninic acid have been detected in many cancer types, including colon carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, etc (–).
PMC6224486	D02014	Interestingly, kynureninic acid was increased in patients with metastases that spread to lymph nodes when compared with nonmetastatic patients.
PMC6224486	D02015	Moreover, a tryptophan catabolic enzyme, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, has been reported as a central driver of malignant development and progression.
PMC6224486	D02016	Our metabolomic analysis of NMIBC grades revealed an association between tryptophan metabolism and the progression of BC.
PMC6224486	D02017	We also observed a decrease in 6-keto-decanoylcarnitine, a member of the acyl carnitine family, in high-grade NMIBC without hematuria vs. low-grade NMIBC.
PMC6224486	D02018	A similar reduction in acyl carnitine metabolites was found in low-grade NMIBC samples compared to the control group.
PMC6224486	D03002	High levels of L-3-hydroxykynurenine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetaldehyde were observed in high-grade NMIBC with hematuria; both metabolites are associated with tryptophan metabolism.

PMC6261534	R00002	Due to the fact that chloroform has a higher density compared to the methanol/water aqueous layer, the organic layer remains on the bottom of the Folch and Bligh-Dyer biphasic solvent extraction systems.
PMC6261534	R00006	The density of MTBE allows for the desired organic layer to remain on the top, aiding in the collection of the lipid content.
PMC6261534	R01000	For the Folch method, the 1:10, 1:20, and 1:100 (v/v) sample-to-solvent ratios provided higher peak areas for Cer(d18:1/22:0) and many LPC/PC lipid classes compared to the 1:4 (v/v) sample-to-solvent ratio.
PMC6261534	R01003	For the Bligh-Dyer method, the 1:10, 1:20, and 1:100 (v/v) sample-to-solvent ratios provided higher peak areas for Cer(d18:1/24:0), all LPCs, and many PC/PE/PG lipid classes compared to the 1:4 (v/v) sample-to-solvent ratio.
PMC6261534	R01005	For the Matyash method, the 1:10, 1:20, and 1:100 (v/v) sample-to-solvent ratios only provided higher peak areas for Cer(d18:1/24:0) and PC(14:0_16:0).
PMC6261534	R01012	As the plasma sample-to-solvent ratio decreased from 1:4, 1:10, 1:20, and 1:100 (v/v), many of the Cer, LPC, PC, and PE lipid species increased in peak area for the Bligh-Dyer, Folch, and Matyash methods as shown in .
PMC6261534	R01015	[] Literature has also suggested that the total solvent volume of 2:1 CHCl_3 :MeOH (v/v) be 17 times higher than the tissue volume to effectively extract lipids as well as to associate weak hydrogen bonds between chloroform and water.
PMC6261534	R01016	[] The Bligh-Dyer and Folch methods provided higher peak areas for LPC lipid species at every sample-to-solvent ratio.
PMC6261534	R01022	While taking into account peak area and repeatability for the Cer, LPC, LPE, PC, PG, and PI lipid classes, the 1:20 (v/v) sample-to-solvent ratio provided the best results for the Folch and Matyash method.
PMC6261534	R01024	Literature has shown mixtures of methanol with more nonpolar solvents that do not have an acidic proton (e.g., tetrachloride and tetrachlorethylene) to solubilize reduced amounts of water, resulting in a lower lipid extraction efficiency.
PMC6261534	R02005	For human plasma studies, the aqueous layer of the Folch, Bligh-Dyer, and Matyash extractions was isolated and compared to a commonly used metabolite isolation protocol, 80% methanol.

PMC6261534	R02010	Compared to the 80% methanol extraction method, the Folch and Bligh-Dyer method yielded the closest results at a 1:20 (v/v) sample-to-solvent ratio and the Bligh-Dyer method was closest at a 1:100 (v/v) sample-to-solvent ratio.
PMC6261534	R02011	With increasing solvent volume up to the 1:20 (v/v) sample-to-solvent ratio, the variability in the aqueous extract decreased for the Folch method, except for caffeine.
PMC6261534	R02013	Caffeine resulted in the highest %CVs for each extraction method, suggesting that a biphasic extraction may be non-optimal for this metabolite.
PMC6261534	R02021	The Matyash has a larger ratio of non-polar solvent (MTBE) to methanol and water (10:3:2.5, v/v/v), resulting in its inability to effectively partition metabolites into the aqueous layer.
PMC6261534	R02024	Comparison of plasma ISTD peak areas for the 80% MeOH [A], Folch [B], Bligh-Dyer [C], and Matyash [D] extraction methods for each human plasma sample-to-solvent ratio (1:4, 1:10, 1:20, and 1:100).
PMC6268088	A00001	Glycation of glucose to human serum albumin in vivo is related to diabetes and many other diseases.
PMC6268088	A00005	We also demonstrate the use of matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to estimate the incorporation ratio of glucose to albumin during glycation.
PMC6268088	M01002	HSA was extracted from serum using PEG precipitation method described by Mashiba and coworkers.
PMC6268088	M01003	Fifty mg of PEG 6000 was added to a 500 µL portion of serum.
PMC6268088	M02002	The column was equilibrated with mobile phase A (250 mM ammonium acetate containing 50 mM magnesium chloride and 5% ethanol, pH 8.5) at flowrate of 1 mL/min.
PMC6268088	M02005	Then mobile phase B (200 mM sorbitol, 100 mM Tris and 50 mM EDTA-2Na, pH 8.5) was pumped through the column until GA was completely eluted.
PMC6268088	M03002	Protein samples were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min in 2X treatment buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.8).
PMC6268088	M04000	NGA and GA samples were incubated with denaturing buffer (0.5 M Tris-HCl, 2.75 mM EDTA, 6 M guanidine-HCl, pH 8.1) at 100 °C for 15 min.
PMC6268088	M04001	After cooled to room temperature, 6 μL of 1 M dithiothreitol solution was added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 10 μL of 1 M iodoacetamide and further incubation in the dark at room temperature for 1 h.
PMC6268088	M04003	Each desalted sample was reconstituted with 19 μL of 25 mM ammonium bicarbonate solution and then aliquoted into two vials.
PMC6268088	M05001	Mobile phase A was 0.1% formic acid in 2% aqueous acetonitrile and mobile phase B was 0.1% formic acid in 98% acetonitrile.
PMC6268088	M06002	Chemical formula C_0 H_0 was input as parent formula for unmodified peptides, while formula C_6 H_10 O_5 , which reflected one glucose incorporated to peptides, was input for glycated peptides.
PMC6268088	R00000	Total HSA was firstly extracted from serum by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation.
PMC6268088	R00002	The NGA was eluted without retention while the GA was bound to the column due to the interaction between cis -diols from glucose residues and the boronate ligands.
PMC6268088	R00003	Mobile phase containing sorbitol was then used to competitively elute GA.
PMC6268088	R00006	The significant elevation of GA level was commonly observed for diabetic patients, as a consequence of high blood glucose level.
PMC6268088	R00019	A slight increase of relative migration distance was observed for the NGA bands compared to the GA bands, possibly induced by the addition of glucose residues to HSA.
PMC6268088	R01001	Trypsin, which cleaves peptides on the C-terminal side of lysine and arginine amino acid residues, is one of the commonly used endoproteinases to produce peptides for MS analysis.
PMC6268088	R01002	Since the glycation occurred at lysine residues, we also used endoproteinase Glu-C to degrade GA besides of trypsin.
PMC6268088	R01021	As the examples shown in , glycated peptides gT34-35 (AEFAEVSKglcLVTDLTK) and gT37-38 (ADLAKglcYICENQDSISSK) were indentified unambiguously by their fragment ions in MS/MS. Lys-525 was reported to be the principal glycation site in healthy person, along with a few lysine residues susceptible to be glycated [,].
PMC6268088	R01024	No glycation was found to occur at arginine or cysteine residues.
PMC6268088	R02000	Glycation affects the conformation and function of HSA by occupying lysine residues.
PMC6268088	R02002	It raises the importance of study incorporation ratio of glucose to albumin in addition to glycation site study.
PMC6268088	R02003	The definition of incorporation ratio here is the average number of glucose molecules attached to each albumin molecule.
PMC6268088	R02005	With internal standard calibration, MALDI-TOF-MS is widely used to obtain the relatively accurate average MW of glycoconjugates.
PMC6268088	R02006	By calculating the MW shift from GA to NGA, the incorporation ratio of glucose to albumin could be deduced as:  where 162 is the MW increase of each glucose attached to albumin.
PMC6268088	R02010	Our hypothesis is that glucose preferred to attack unmodified HSA instead of already glycated HSA.
PMC6303059	A00006	Metabolites involved in serotonergic synapse/ tryptophan metabolism (Serotonin and 5-Hydroxy-3-indoleacetic acid [5-HIAA]) were only detected in normal tissue samples.
PMC6303059	A00007	On the other hand, S-Adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), a metabolite involves in methionine metabolism and methylation, was frequently increased in tumor relative to normal tissues.
PMC6303059	D00014	More recently, Satoh et al., using CE-MS metabolome for profiling paired tumor and normal tissue from Japanese patients with CRC, found that S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) was the most up-regulated metabolite in tumor tissue.
PMC6303059	D00016	In this study, it was shown that diverse metabolic pathways (such as N-glycan biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, cholesterol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, amino acid metabolism and steroid hormone biosynthesis) differs between tumor and normal tissues.
PMC6303059	D00018	The finding of SAM by Satoh et al. and subsequently SAH in our study to be frequently elevated in tumor tissues highlighted the importance of cysteine and methionine metabolism in carcinogenesis.
PMC6303059	D00019	Methionine, an essential amino acid in protein synthesis, is the precursor to SAM required by a variety of methyltransferases for the methylation of DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids.
PMC6303059	D00020	When SAM releases activated methyl group in methylation reactions, it is transformed into SAH that is further hydrolyzed to homocysteine.
PMC6303059	D00021	Sibani et al. has demonstrated that there was positive correlations between SAM, SAH, and DNA hypomethylation with cellular transformation under folate-adequate conditions in pre-neoplastic small intestine of multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mice, thus illustrating the importance of SAM and SAH in DNA methylation and colorectal carcinogenesis.
PMC6303059	D00022	Furthermore, several cancer cells utilize SAM for hyperactive polyamine synthesis.
PMC6303059	D00023	In turn, polyamine putrescine reacts with a decarboxylated form of SAM to form spermidine and spermine.
PMC6303059	D00024	Therefore, this may explain the elevation of SAH and depletion of spermidine at tumor sites compared surrounding non-affected mucosa.
PMC6303059	D00025	Serotonin, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is mainly synthesized at the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and it is closely associated with GI function and physiology as extensively reviewed by Manocha and Khan.
PMC6303059	D00026	In intestinal enterochromaffin (EC) cells, conversion of dietary tryptophan is the first step in the biosynthesis of serotonin, has been implicated in various GI diseases and functional disorders.
PMC6303059	D00027	Alteration in serotonin signaling is associated with celiac disease, CRC, and diverticular disease.
PMC6303059	D00028	The absence of serotonin at tumor sites compared to corresponding adjacent non-involved sites may suggest increased catabolism of serotonin by cancerous cells.
PMC6303059	D00029	Serotonin is essential for the growth of s.c.
PMC6303059	D00031	The intricate interactions of the gut microbiota, food consumed, and intestinal cells together will impact the serotonin production, secretion, and degradation, and, hence, may be accountable for the impaired function of serotonin in GI diseases.
PMC6303059	D00032	Thus, modulation of tryptophan metabolism, such as the production of serotonin can be used as a potential therapeutic strategy for CRC in the future.
PMC6303059	D00033	2,2'-Diketospirilloxanthin is a naturally occurring carotenoid.
PMC6303059	D00034	Carotenoids are organic pigments produced by many plants and algae, as well as by various bacteria and fungi.
PMC6303059	D00035	Natural carotenoids, because of their antioxidant properties, have been suggested to have anticarcinogenic activity.
PMC6303059	D00036	On the other hand, a prospective Multiethnic Cohort Study based on quantitative food frequency questionnaires did not find any significant association between intake of individual and total carotenoids and CRC risk.
PMC6303059	D00037	The detection of 2,2'-diketospirilloxanthin at cancerous sites but not adjacent non-involved sites suggests that the carotenoid may have local protective effects on epithelial tissues.
PMC6303059	D00048	Interestingly, many naturally occurring triterpenoids have been shown to exhibit cytotoxicity against tumor cells, as well as demonstrated to have anticancer efficacy in vivo .
PMC6303059	M02003	Briefly, 100 μl of chloroform (HPLC grade; Friendemann Schmidt Chemical, Australia) and 200 μl of methanol (HPLC grade; Friendemann Schmidt Chemical, Australia) were added to the fine powder and resuspended by vigorous vortexing.

PMC6303059	R05002	The microbial communities of tumor samples had significant enrichments in both fatty acid biosynthesis and glycerolipid metabolism, while the normal microbial subsets were significantly enriched for pathways associated with citrate cycle, steroid biosynthesis, C5-branched dibasic acid metabolism, pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis, and sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis.
PMC6303059	R05004	The abundances of Anaerotruncus , Intestinimonas and Oscillibacter exhibited significant relationships with both steroid biosynthesis and sesquiterpenoid and triterpenoid biosynthesis pathways in both tumor and normal tissue samples with Anaerotruncus showing the most significant associations (p -values < 0.0001) (; ).

PMC6314687	A00000	Oxylipins are bioactive mediators that play diverse roles in (patho)physiology.
PMC6314687	A00001	We developed a sensitive and selective ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method for the simultaneous profiling of 57 targeted oxylipins derived from five major n-6 and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) that serve as oxylipin precursors, including linoleic (LA), arachidonic (AA), alpha-linolenic (ALA), eicosapentaenoic (EPA), and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids.
PMC6314687	A00002	The targeted oxylipin panel provides broad coverage of lipid mediators and pathway markers generated from cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, cytochrome P450 epoxygenases/hydroxylases, and non-enzymatic oxidation pathways.
PMC6314687	A00004	This is the first methodology to incorporate four hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoic acids and four keto-epoxy-octadecenoic acids into an oxylipin profiling network.
PMC6314687	A00005	The novel method achieves excellent resolution and allows in-depth analysis of isomeric and isobaric species of oxylipin extracts in biological samples.
PMC6314687	A00006	The method was quantitatively characterized in human plasma with good linearity (R = 0.990–0.999), acceptable reproducibility (relative standard deviation (RSD) < 20% for the majority of analytes), accuracy (67.8 to 129.3%) for all analytes, and recovery (66.8–121.2%) for all analytes except 5,6-EET.
PMC6314687	A00008	Basal levels of targeted oxylipins determined in plasma and serum are in agreement with those previously reported in literature.

PMC6314687	M00004	Forty-seven non-deuterated and nine deuterated standards of target oxylipins were ordered from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI, USA), or Larodan (Malmo, Sweden) with purity of ≥ 98% according to the manufacturer.
PMC6314687	M00006	Four hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoic acids [9-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-octadecenoic acid (9-H-12-E-LA), 11-hydroxy-12,13-epoxy-octadecenoic acid (11-H-12-E-LA), 11-hydroxy-9,10-epoxy-octadecenoic acid (11-H-9-E-LA), 13-hydroxy-9,10-epoxy-octadecenoic acid (13-H-9-E-LA)] and three keto-epoxy-octadecenoic acids [11-keto-12,13-epoxyoctadecenoic acid (11-K-12-E-LA), 11-keto-9,10-epoxyoctadecenoic acid (11-K-9-E-LA), 13-keto-9,10-epoxyoctadecenoic acid (13-K-9-E-LA)] employed in this study were custom-synthesized by Cayman Chemical with purities of > 95%.
PMC6314687	M00009	The occurrences of analyte cross-talk interferences have been minimized and discussed in sections “Resolution of isomers to prevent inter channel cross-talk” and “Resolution of targeted hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoic acids and keto-epoxyoctadecenoic acids” in Results and Discussion.
PMC6314687	M01001	Baseline fasting whole blood was collected into 10 ml ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes.

PMC6314687	M03000	Stock solutions of standard compounds were prepared in ethanol at a concentration of 100 ng/μL for all analytes except 1000 ng/uL for 9-HODE and 9-HOTrE. An intermediate stock solution of the 50 analytes was prepared at 1 ng/uL for all analytes except 10 ng/uL for 9-HODE and 9-HOTrE by mixing stock solutions of each analyte in methanol.
PMC6314687	M03001	We used methanol to make standard working solutions since methanol is the common organic solvent used for the preparation of oxylipin calibration standards [, , ].
PMC6314687	M03002	Also, it has been reported that the solubilities in methanol are 3.04 g/L at −70 °C for LA, 13.8 g/L at − 62 °C for ALA, and 50 mg/ml for AA and EPA (Product Information Sheet from Sigma-Aldrich).
PMC6314687	M03003	DHA is soluble in methanol (LipidBank DHA).
PMC6314687	M03004	Oxylipins are oxidative metabolites of PUFA and are known to be more polar than their respective precursor PUFA.
PMC6314687	M03005	The increased polarities cause them to dissolve more readily in methanol based on the principle that “like dissolve like.”
PMC6314687	M03006	Therefore, oxylipin solubilities in methanol at the concentrations used in our work will not be a problem.
PMC6314687	M03007	Calibrator working solutions were prepared by dilution from this intermediate stock solution with methanol to achieve concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 ng/mL for all analytes except 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 50,000, and 10,000 ng/mL for 9-HODE and 9-HOTrE. The quality control (QC) working solutions were prepared separately in the same fashion at five concentrations of 2, 5, 10, 100, and 800 ng/mL for all analytes except 20, 50, 100, 1000, and 8000 ng/mL for 9-HODE and 9-HOTrE. Both working solutions of calibrators and QCs were aliquoted.
PMC6314687	M03009	A mixture of nine deuterated working internal standard (IS) solutions were similarly prepared by each individual stock (100 ng/μL) of internal standard to give a final concentration of 20 ng/mL in methanol.
PMC6314687	M04000	Oxylipins are endogenously present in plasma, where they can reach relatively high concentrations (10–20 μM for certain species) and no analyte-free matrix is available.
PMC6314687	M04001	Therefore, phosphate buffer saline (PBS)-methanol containing BHT/EDTA was used as a surrogate matrix (referred to as PMC).
PMC6314687	M04002	The PMC matrix was freshly prepared by mixing 200 μL of PBS (100 mM) and 500 μL of cold methanol containing 20 mg/mL BHT/EDTA in an ice bath.
PMC6314687	M04003	The calibration standards were prepared by spiking with 20 μL of the appropriate calibrator working solution into 700 μL of PMC in Eppendorf tube kept in ice, resulting in the calibration concentrations of 0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 ng/mL for all analytes except 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 ng/mL for 9-HODE and 9-HOTrE in the final solution.
PMC6314687	M04005	The final concentrations of QC samples at five levels were 0.2, 0.5, 1, 10, and 80 ng/mL for all analytes except 2, 5, 10, 100, and 800 for 9-HODE and 9-HOTrE in the final solution.
PMC6314687	M05003	A volume of 200 μL of sample was pipetted into 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and 500 μL of cold methanol containing 20 mg/mL BHT/EDTA was immediately added.
PMC6314687	M05005	After removing from the − 80 °C freezer, 50 μL of the IS working solution and 20 μL of methanol were added to all samples.
PMC6314687	M06000	Oxylipins were extracted using polymer-based reversed-phase Strata-X cartridges (33 μm, 200 mg/6 mL; Phenomenex, PA).
PMC6314687	M06002	The cartridge was preconditioned with 6 mL methanol and 6 mL water.
PMC6314687	M06005	The cartridge was then washed with 6 mL of 10% methanol in water and air-dried for approximately 2 min.
PMC6314687	M06007	Afterwards, the metabolites were eluted with 6 mL methanol containing 0.0004% w/v BHT into a glass tube containing 10 μL of 30% glycerol in methanol.
PMC6314687	M06009	The residues were reconstituted with 40 μL of methanol, transferred to amber autosampler vials, and an aliquot (10 μL) was injected into the LC-MS/MS system.
PMC6314687	M07000	Due to the lipophilic nature of oxylipins and lack of protein in PMC matrix, there may be non-specific bindings which result in the loss of analytes through adsorption, especially to the hydrophobic surface of the polypropylene materials during transfer with tubes, vials, and tips in sample preparation.
PMC6314687	M07001	The experiments to check for analyte loss during container transfer were performed in the PMC matrix at concentration levels of 0.1 and 0.2 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL for all analytes and 0.5 ng/mL for RvD2, 11-H-9-E LAs, and 11-H-12-E LAs (n = 4 for each).
PMC6314687	M07005	The solution was decanted into the preconditioned cartridge with 6 mL of methanol and 6 mL of water.
PMC6314687	M07006	After the samples had passed through the cartridges, they were washed with 6 mL of 10% methanol and eluted with 6 mL of methanol containing 0.0004% w/v BHT into a glass tube that had 10 μL of 30% glycerol in methanol.
PMC6314687	M12006	For accuracy of plasma oxylipin measurements, oxylipin concentrations were corrected by subtracting the endogenous concentration from each sample.
PMC6314687	R00000	The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive method for the quantitation of 57 oxylipins derived from LA (n = 19), AA (n = 19), ALA (n = 2), EPA (n = 3), and DHA (n = 14) from plasma in a single UPLC-MS/MS run.
PMC6314687	R00001	Despite recent advances in LC-MS, development of analytical methods for lipidomic profiling of oxylipins from biological matrices has been challenging due to low concentrations, wide dynamic range of their physiological concentrations, interference from complex matrices, high structural similarity, and high number of isomeric and isobaric species of oxylipins.
PMC6314687	R02002	The mobile phases were tested with different organic modifiers (acetonitrile and acetonitrile/water mixtures at various concentrations in water) and a low amount of formic acid or acetic acid.
PMC6314687	R02003	The buffer strength of the mobile phases was investigated with ammonium formate and ammonium acetate.
PMC6314687	R02004	Ammonium acetate buffer provided better separation of isomers and was investigated for improving the resolutions of H-E-LAs or K-E-LAs.
PMC6314687	R02005	Four different concentrations of ammonium acetate: 4, 10, 12, and 15 mM were tested in the mobile phase.
PMC6314687	R02006	We found that 12 mM ammonium acetate yielded the best separation.
PMC6314687	R02009	Finally, the optimal UPLC separation of the target oxylipins was achieved using an ZorBAX RRHD Eclipse Plus C18 column filled with 1.8 μm particles and a gradient elution with mobile phases 0.02% aqueous acetic acid and acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (90:10/0.02 v/v/v ) both containing 12 mM ammonium acetate.
PMC6314687	R02010	A representative chromatogram of 57 targeted oxylipins injected on the UPLC-MS/MS system is presented in Electronic .
PMC6314687	R03000	When highly specific LC-MS/MS MRM with unique transition is used, the chromatographic separation is often not required such as in co-eluting pairs of regioisomers, 5-HETE and 8-HETE, 9-HETE and 15-HETE, 8,9-EET and 12-EET, 7-HDHA and 10-HDHA.
PMC6314687	R03007	Our method achieved excellent chromatographic separation of the target oxylipins with similar MS/MS spectra.
PMC6314687	R03008	For example, PD1 and PDX differ in double bond geometry and stereochemistry of the hydroxyl group at C10 position; PGF_2α and 8-isoPGF_2α stereoisomers differ in the configuration of the C7–C8 bond; and PGE_2 and PGD_2 regioisomers bear similar major fragment ions.
PMC6314687	R03010	Moreover, isobaric species, such as hydroxy-PUFA, were all baseline resolved from corresponding epoxy-PUFA.
PMC6314687	R03011	Two pairs of regioisomers, 9-HETE and 11-HETE (319 > 167), 7-HDHA and 17-HDHA (343 > 245) were nearly baseline separated.
PMC6314687	R03012	However, 9,10,13-TriHOME and 9,12,13-TriHOME (329 > 171) only partially resolved.
PMC6314687	R03013	Furthermore, for coeluting isomers 9-HODE and 13-HODE, and partially resolved isomers 9-EpOME and 13-EpOME, 9-HODE and 9-EpOME were each found to produce a very minor peak at m/z 195, forming an MRM transition 295 > 195, corresponding to less than 1% of the response at the same concentration level for 13-HODE and 13-EpOME.
PMC6314687	R03016	Mas et al. obtained a partial chromatographic resolution for PD1 and PDX by means of LCMS/MS system consisting of a Zorbax Eclipse XDB C18 column and 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate pH 9 and methanol as the mobile phase.
PMC6314687	R03017	Chromatographic separation of critical isomer pairs: PGE_2 and PGD_2 (upper), PGF_2α and 8-isoPGF_2α (middle), and PD1 and PDX (bottom).
PMC6314687	R04000	Seven out of eight targeted hydroxy-epoxy-octadecenoic acid (H-E-LAs) and keto-epoxy-octadecenoic acid (K-E-LAs) are not commercially available.
PMC6314687	R04002	Two methods have been described for partial analysis of H-E-LAs or K-E-LAs, one for quantifying 9-K-12-E-LA in human plasma and the other for separating four stereo-isomeric 13-H-9-E-LA enantiomers using SP-HPLC analysis on a silica column.
PMC6314687	R04004	Each synthesized compound was prepared selectively with respect to double bond and epoxide geometry; however, each chiral center was prepared non-selectively so that hydroxyls were racemic and absolute configuration of epoxides was not determined.
PMC6314687	R04007	Therefore, each H-E-LAs and K-ELAs can theoretically have eight or four structural isomers, respectively, although based on our predictions, there would be expected to be only four isomers of hydroxy-epoxides and two for each keto epoxide [, ].
PMC6314687	R04008	Under our UPLC-MS/MS system, five out of seven synthesized standards were observed to contain a mixture of the related isomers: four peaks for 11-H-9-E-LA (3b, 3c, 3d, 3e), three for 11-H-12-ELA (3g, 3h, 3i), four for 13-K-9-E-LA (3j, 3k, 3l, 3m), three for 11-K-9-E-LA (3n, 3o, 3p), and three for 11-K-12-E-LA (3r, 3s, 3t), and one peak for both 13-H-9-E-LA (3a) and 9-H-12-E-LA (3f).
PMC6314687	R04010	Additional (>2) peaks that were observed for certain keto-epoxides could potentially be introduced through double bond isomerization during sample preparation and storage.
PMC6314687	R04014	For instance, the major product ions at m/z 139, 171, and 211 of 13-H-9-E-LA (3a) are the identical major ions shown in 9-H-12-E-LA spectrum (3f).
PMC6314687	R04016	In the cases of closely eluted peaks 3c (11-H-9-E-LA) and 3f (9-H-12-ELA); and 3d, 3e (11-H-9-E-LA) and respective 3h, 3i (11-H-12-E-LA), the corresponding characteristic ions at m/z 201, 193, and 197, were chosen as MRM transition ions for 11-H-9-E-LA, 9-H-12-E-LA, and 11-H-12-E-LA, respectively, to allow their differentiation and quantitation.
PMC6314687	R04022	(c) Fragmentation patterns of H-E-LAs and K-E-Las Similarly, for the K-E-LA group, the three major fragment ions of 13-K-9-E-LA (m/z 137, 155, 171) and of 9-K-12-ELA (m/z 165, 193, 209) are all present in the fragment patterns of 11-K-9-E-LA and 11-K-12-E-LA, respectively.
PMC6314687	R04023	Therefore, chromatographic separations of peaks between 13-K-9-E-LA and 11-K-9-E-LA, and 9-K-12-E-LA and 11-K-12-E-LA are required for quantitation.
PMC6314687	R05000	Many common sample preparation methods including protein precipitation, liquid-liquid extraction, and SPE have been used for analysis of oxylipins.
PMC6314687	R05002	Liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) with organic solvents provides poor extraction of hydrophilic compounds such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes.
PMC6314687	R05004	The most common sample preparation method used to minimize matrix effects and increase sensitivity in oxylipin profiling is methanol precipitation followed by SPE.
PMC6314687	R05005	C18-bonded silica or polymeric sorbent (Strata-X and Oasis HLB) SPEs are used most often.
PMC6314687	R05007	During method development, we observed that acidification of the loading solution to pH 4 with 1 M HCL resulted in a loss of approximately 70% of 13-H-9-E-LA (data not shown).
PMC6314687	R05009	By contrast, neutral loading without acidification of the loading solution greatly improved recovery of 13-H-9-E-LA (86.9 to 107.1% across concentration range) and achieved good recoveries for all other analytes except 5,6-EET, although these acidic analytes would likely be charged at a neutral condition.
PMC6314687	R05012	Recovery of targeted oxylipins from quality control samples at five different concentration levels (n = 3 or 4) Recoveries (RC) of oxylipins were evaluated using four or five spiked concentrations for PMC and plasma, respectively, and oxylipin levels in plasma were adjusted for endogenous level subtraction.
PMC6314687	R06000	Container transfer loss of analytes in the PMC matrix was assessed at low concentration levels of 0.1 or 0.2 ng/mL and a higher level of 1 ng/mL for all analytes and 0.5 ng/mL for RvD2, 11-H-9-E LAs, and 11-H-12-E LAs (n = 4) during sample preparation and results were expressed as percent recoveries.
PMC6314687	R06001	gave the overall recovery of analytes at these concentration levels ranging from 68.9 to 114.6% with RSD less than 15% for majority of analytes except low recovery for 5,6-EET that has been discussed in the section of Recovery and matrix effects below.
PMC6314687	R06004	Interestingly, other investigators found that using water as the surrogate matrix led to a significant loss, with only approximately 10% recoveries of oxylipins following extraction.
PMC6314687	R06005	In our case, the surrogate matrix PMC in the Eppendorf tube consisted of greater than 71% methanol.
PMC6314687	R06008	It is likely that the greater than 70% methanol concentration facilitated the disruption of container surface adsorption.
PMC6314687	R06009	Blanc et al. reported that container surface adsorption to cannabinoid calibrators can be reversed by ethanol extraction.
PMC6314687	R06012	Yang et al. reported good recovery for the 39 oxylipins spiked in PBS solution going through SPE.
PMC6314687	R07003	Despite having 57 targeted oxylipins included in the current method development, seven of them, PD1, RvD_3, RvD_4 , and four K-E-LAs have not been included in the evaluation due to availability of only small amounts of analytical standards for spiking.
PMC6314687	R08004	Values for LLOQs were in the range of 0.1 to 1 ng/mgL and are presented in , and representative MRM chromatograms of oxylipins at the LLOQ concentrations are shown in .
PMC6314687	R08009	The results of correlation coefficients (R ) and calibration ranges for all targeted 50 oxylipins are listed in .
PMC6314687	R09002	Stability of 5,6-EET and deuterated 5,6-EET-d_11 decreased to 61 and 57%, respectively, at this storage condition for plasma extract at 24 h relative to 0 h.
PMC6314687	R09003	This decrease may be due to instability of 5,6-EET in acidic and neutral conditions [, ].
PMC6314687	R09004	Loss of 5,6-EET during sample storage was compensated by the use of deuterated 5,6-EET-d_11 as internal standard during quantitation of 5,6-EET as shown in .
PMC6314687	R09007	The results revealed all analytes except 5,6-EET are stable in the reconstitute solution at 4 °C within the duration of 24 h.
PMC6314687	R09008	Recently, Wang et al. examined autosampler stability of 104 oxylipins including 41 of oxylipins in our assay and found less than 20% loss in plasma extract when stored at 4 °C for 8 h in the autosampler loading tray.
PMC6314687	R09009	It is worth to mention that Wolfer et al. have reported stabilities of long-term storage (− 80 °C for 20 weeks), undergoing three freeze-thaw cycles, for 43 oxylipins generated from LA, AA, EPA, and DHA across concentration levels ranging from 0.5 to 250 ng/mL in MeOH/H2O (1:1) and found no significant loss (< 15%) over the storage period.
PMC6314687	R09010	We did not conduct the analyte long-term storage stability (− 80 °C) in the methanol working solution.
PMC6314687	R10004	A total of 41 of the 50 oxylipins quantified in PMC showed accuracy in the range of 80.5–118.5% across four QC levels and 69.3–127.1% for all except 11-H-9-E-LA and 11-H-12-ELA that had interday accuracy of 143.1 and 139.6% at LLOQ level.
PMC6314687	R10006	The interday RSDs ranged from 4.3 to 15.0% for 44 out of 50 across the concentration levels and 16.7% for 12,13-EpOME at LLOQ level except five analytes (13-oxoODE, 9,12,13-TriHOME, 13-H-9-E-LA, 9-H-12-E-LA, and 11-H-12-E-LA) with RSDs of 21.7–27.7% at LLOQ or medium QC levels.
PMC6314687	R10007	For all five QC levels, 42 out of 50 oxylipins quantified in the plasma samples showed accuracy in the range of 70.3 and 120.5%.
PMC6314687	R10008	Overall, all 50 oxylipins had accuracy between 67.8 and 129.3%.
PMC6314687	R10010	The interday RSDs for 35 out of 50 were ≤ 15% across the concentration range, for 10 of 50 analytes between 15 and 20% at LOQ or LLOQ levels, and except for 5 of 50 analytes (9-oxoODE, 13-oxoODE, 13-HOTrE, 18-HEPE, and 17-HDHA) that had RSDs ranging between 23.3 and 30.1% at LOQ, or LLOQ levels.
PMC6314687	R10011	A significant batch-to-batch variation has been observed for 13-HOTrE and 18-HEPE (as high as 70%).
PMC6314687	R10012	It is worth mentioning that four analytes 9,10-EpOME, 12,13-EpOME, 9,10,13-TriHOME and 9,12,13-TriHOME showed good sensitivity, but large variations were observed for the concentrations between LOQs and LLOQs (data not shown), which will require further investigation.
PMC6314687	R10014	Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that the method is reproducible and reliable for the majority of oxylipins analyzed across these concentration ranges.
PMC6314687	R11003	Recoveries of 80 to 110% were achieved for most oxylipins.
PMC6314687	R11004	Forty-nine out of the of 50 analytes showed recoveries in the range of 66.8 to 121.2% except 5,6-EET that showed recoveries of 38.3–66.2% across three QC concentration levels (QC3 to QC5) in PMC and plasma.
PMC6314687	R11005	Since no matrix suppression was observed, low recoveries of 5,6-EET most likely resulted from degradation and losses during sample preparation, which were compensated by the use of deuterated 5,6-EET-d_11 as indicated in its accuracy determination.
PMC6314687	R11007	oxoODE (21.9% in PMC), 13-HOTrE (25.5% in plasma), and 20-HETE (21.8% in PMC) at the lowest QC1level.
PMC6314687	R11009	Their results showed slightly lower recoveries for 17 deuterated internal standards (62.1–92.8%) compared to the same 17 unlabeled oxylipins.
PMC6314687	R11010	In the present study, the observed recovery range of 86.9–107.9% at 1 ng/mL concentration in plasma indicates the effectiveness of the procedures to extract the targeted oxylipins from PMC and plasma samples.
PMC6314687	R11014	Among the 50 oxylipins evaluated, 14 observed signal enhancement effects, with some results ranging from 123.3 to 144.5% across the concentration range, while others fell within that range for only one or two concentration levels and RSD values were < 17.2% suggesting that these matrix effects are reproducible.
PMC6314687	R12000	The method was successfully applied to determine basal concentrations of the targeted oxylipins in human plasma and serum.
PMC6314687	R12003	shows that basal levels of oxylipins in plasma and serum obtained from our studies are in agreement with those previously reported by others
PMC6314687	R12005	Our results of higher 12-HETE levels in serum than in plasma corroborate earlier investigations [, , ].
PMC6314687	R12006	Higher levels of the 12-LOX products 12-HETE and 14-HDHA in serum are likely due to activation of platelet-derived 12-LOX during the clotting cascade.
PMC6314687	R12007	Similarly, remarkable differences were also observed in basal levels of oxylipins for human serum.
PMC6314687	R12009	The identities of novel incorporated compounds, H-E-LAs, K-E-LAs, and 9,10,11-TriHOME, in plasma were confirmed by comparing retention times and product ion spectra with authentic standard.
PMC6314687	R12010	The novel methodology is capable of detecting oxylipin changes from clinical and preclinical studies and has now been used to quantify these eight lipid mediators in human and rodent skin and in human serum and plasma.
PMC6314687	R12014	In future studies, we plan to synthesize additional standards of K-E-LAs to expand method performance evaluation, and to incorporate targeted PUFAs in order to investigate how parent PUFA levels relate to their corresponding oxylipin derivatives.

PMC6315767	A00004	The differentiated metabolites identified in the CD samples included tyrosine, an ornithine isomer, arachidonic acid, eicosatrienoic acid, docosatetraenoic acid, a sphingomyelin, a ceramide, and dimethylsphinganine.
PMC6315767	D00002	who found elevations of the following metabolites in faecal samples from CD patients: aspartate, glycine, tryptophan, carnosine, allantoin, citrulline, serine, threonine, ornithine, creatine, asparagine, choline, kynurenine, histidine, taurine, phenylalanine, alanine, and metanephrine.
PMC6315767	D00004	Jannson et al. found that tyrosine and its metabolites as well as phenylalanine and tryptophan were significantly higher in CD patients.
PMC6315767	D00005	In the current study, tyrosine levels were significantly lower in the pre-EEN treatment versus the HC samples and remained either lower or significantly lower throughout the treatment and post-treatment samples (Table S1 and Figure S4).
PMC6315767	D00006	In another study, Bjerrum et al. found that leucine, isoleucine, valine, lysine, alanine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and glycine were all present at high levels in faecal extracts from CD patients compared to healthy controls.
PMC6315767	D00007	The study by Bjerrum is in agreement with our results except for the tyrosine levels, which were consistently lower.
PMC6315767	D00008	Schicho et al. reported increased levels of methionine, lysine, glycine, arginine, and proline and decreased levels of valine, tyrosine, and serine in faecal extracts from CD patients.
PMC6315767	D00009	Schicho et al.’s findings regarding tyrosine levels reflect our tyrosine results, but we found that valine and serine were either consistently higher than the controls or no different from the controls.
PMC6315767	D00013	For example, in the current study, taurine is significantly higher in most of the treated and untreated patient samples in comparison with the control (Table S1), and it is tempting to conclude that taurine is an important disease marker, given its anti-inflammatory effects.
PMC6315767	D00014	However, the Q-Q test indicated that taurine was not normally distributed and appears to be normally distributed in two groups (Figure S3); thus, its p values could not be reported.
PMC6315767	D00015	The same was true for acetyl choline, which was significantly higher in all the patient samples but did not pass the QQ test returning a low R_2 value (Figure S3).
PMC6315767	D00021	Six out of the eight markers were normally distributed with the ceramide (SM (d18:1/24:1)) having too many missing values to give normal distribution (Figure S3).
PMC6315767	D00023	Only two marker compounds were reduced in the CD patients, tyrosine and an ornithine isomer.
PMC6315767	D00024	Tyrosine has previously been reported as a CD marker that was increased in faecal extracts from CD patients and decreased in the plasma from CD patients.
PMC6315767	D00025	In our study, the low tyrosine levels were not significantly changed after EEN treatment in comparison with the HC group.
PMC6315767	D00026	Several tyrosine metabolites were also present in low amounts in the CD patients, including dopamine, noradrenaline, metanephrine, normetanephrine, adrenaline, and DOPA.
PMC6315767	D00027	Catecholamines are normally at very low concentrations in plasma, but the levels excreted in urine are generally much higher.
PMC6315767	D00028	There is no substantial literature on the levels of catecholamines in faeces.
PMC6315767	D00030	The other marker compound that was found at reduced levels in our analysis of CD patients, with an average intensity of 0.15 compared to that in the healthy controls, was an ornithine isomer.
PMC6315767	D00031	Since ornithine has two basic centres, it runs very late in our HILIC method, while the marker compound ran much earlier than the ornithine standard.
PMC6315767	D00032	Two ornithine isomers were present in our database; one of these would have been expected to elute late from the column since it is a diamine, but N4-acetyl-N4-hydroxy-1-aminopropane would be expected to elute early.
PMC6315767	D00033	This ornithine isomer is found as a biosynthetic intermediate in the synthesis of siderophores in Rhizobia bacteria, but whether similar pathways might exist in the microbiome bacteria is not known.
PMC6315767	D00034	Dietary omega 6 fatty acids that include arachidonic acid and eicosatrienoic acid may be implicated in IBD.
PMC6315767	D00035	In our study, the levels of arachidonic acid, eicosatrienoic acid, and docosatetraenoic acid were much higher in the CD patients compared to the HC group ( and ) and remained high both pre- and post-EEN treatment.
PMC6315767	D00044	Omega 3 fatty acids have been shown to promote the formation of intestinal alkaline phosphatase, which breaks down the potent pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharides produced by Escherichia coli , which may, in turn, drive CD inflammation.
PMC6315767	D00046	The role of sphingomyelins and ceramides in CD has been investigated, with variable findings [,,].
PMC6315767	D00047	In the current study, three of the elevated markers in the CD patients were in the sphingolipid category.
PMC6315767	D00048	The sphingolipid levels were not greatly affected by EEN treatment.
PMC6315767	D00049	A previous study observed that probiotic bacteria in a mouse IBD model produced a neutral sphingomyelinase that could convert sphingomyelin into ceramides, promoting apoptosis of mucosal immune cells leading to improved homeostasis and reduced inflammation.
PMC6315767	D00050	This theory would explain the elevated sphingomyelin levels in the current study, but it does not conform to the elevated levels of pro-apoptotic ceramides found in the CD samples (Supplementary Table S3).
PMC6315767	D00051	Of note, Sewell et al. found no differences in the ceramide composition of macrophages taken from CD patients compared to a control group.
PMC6315767	D00052	The ceramides monitored in that study corresponded largely to those shown in Supplementary Table S2.
PMC6315767	D00054	Confidence in the identity of two of the sphingolipids is high and comprehensive fragmentation schemes are shown in Figures S6 and S10.
PMC6315767	D00055	However, complete elucidation of the structure of the ceramide so far eludes us.
PMC6315767	M00000	High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade acetonitrile (ACN) was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK), and HPLC grade water was produced by a Direct-Q3 UltrapureWater System (Millipore, Watford, UK).
PMC6315767	M00001	AnalaR-grade formic acid (98%) was obtained from BDH-Merck (Poole, UK).
PMC6315767	M00002	Authentic stock standard metabolites (Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) were prepared as previously described and diluted four times with ACN.
PMC6315767	M00003	The quantification of fatty acids was performed using commercial standards: arachidonic acid, (CAS number 506-32-1, Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK) and Cis-8, 11, 14-Eicosatrienoic acid (CAS number 1783-84-2, Sigma-Aldrich, Poole, UK).
PMC6315767	M01006	Four patients (2 newly diagnosed and 2 patients on relapse) were on concomitant treatment with azathioprine and three on 5-aminoasalicylates.
PMC6315767	M02000	Mobile phase solvents were freshly prepared and stored at room temperature for up to 48 h. Mobile phase A: ammonium carbonate buffer (20 mM, pH 9.2) was prepared by the addition of 1.92 g of ammonium carbonate to 800 mL of HPLC-grade water, followed by an adjustment to pH 9.2 with ammonia solution and then filled to a volume of 1 L. Mobile phase B: HPLC-grade acetonitrile only.
PMC6315767	M02001	The metabolites were eluted from the ZICpHILIC column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 µm particle size) supplied by Hichrom Ltd. (Reading, UK) with a mobile phase consisting of 20 mM ammonium carbonate in HPLC-grade water (solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B), at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min.
PMC6315767	M02004	The mobile phase for the elution of the ACE C4 column consisted of 1 mM acetic acid in water (A) and 1 mM acetic acid in acetonitrile (B) at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min.
PMC6315767	R01033	The levels of an ornithine isomer and tyrosine were significantly lower in the PA samples than the HC group (Log2 (PA/HC) =
PMC6315767	R01034	−2.74 and −1.43 for the ornithine isomer and tyrosine, respectively).
PMC6315767	R01036	The eight marker compounds remained largely significantly lower or higher than the controls although some of the metabolites moved closer to the control levels, with the effect being most marked for arachidonic acid and ceramide.
PMC6315767	R01041	Quite definitive identification of the C20 sphinganine and the C18 sphingosine was achieved.
PMC6315767	R01042	Clear and logical fragments were obtained for the isomer of ornithine although the MS_2 was weak, however it would be difficult to propose a definitive structure based on these.
PMC6315767	R01043	The ceramide yielded abundant fragments it was not possible to make sense of these.
PMC6315767	R01044	There was one fragment at 264.2 in low resolution in MS_3 mode which was the same as a fragment obtained for the C18 sphingosine which is associated with the C18 sphinganine core of the molecule.
PMC6315767	R01053	To confirm their identity, two marker fatty acids, arachidonic acid and eicosatrienoic acid, were matched against the retention times of their corresponding standards on a C4 reversed phase column.
PMC6316856	A00003	LC-MS/MS was used to quantify acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and bile acids.
PMC6316856	A00004	RYGB caused a rapid increase in acylcarnitine levels that proved to be only transient, contrasting with the sustained decrease in phosphatidylcholines and increase of sphingomyelins and bile acids.
PMC6316856	A00006	These included the BCAA-derived acylcarnitines and sphingomyelins with 16 and 18 carbons.
PMC6316856	A00007	We found important correlations between the levels of BCAA-derived acylcarnitines and specific sphingomyelins with plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol concentrations.
PMC6316856	A00008	Along with the marked weight loss and clinical improvements, RYGB induced specific alterations in plasma acylcarnitines, bile acid and phospholipid levels.

PMC6316856	D00004	In the present study, an increase in blood acylcarnitine levels at day 15 post surgery was observed, but levels fell again and returned almost to starting levels.
PMC6316856	D00006	A rapid and sustained decrease in phosphatidylcholines and an increase of sphingomyelins also occurred.
PMC6316856	D00007	Acylcarnitines are intermediaries of FA and amino acid catabolism.
PMC6316856	D00008	Carnitine availability is essential for these processes and depends on dietary intake and endogenous synthesis.
PMC6316856	D00009	Carnitine uptake and synthesis are regulated by PPAR-α and stimulated by dietary energy restriction.
PMC6316856	D00010	In this study, the levels of C2 and other acylcarnitines, increased in blood 15 days after surgery, indicating increased use of endogenous substrates due to the lower caloric intake.
PMC6316856	D00012	It has been previously shown that during dietary energy restriction, there is a decrease in energy expenditure [,] and Schooman et al observed a similar change in AC levels in subjects undergoing caloric restriction but not RYGB surgery.
PMC6316856	D00013	Propionylcarnitine, isobutyrylcarnitine, 2-methyl-butyrylcarnitine, isovalerylcarnitine and methyl-malonylcarnitine are all products of BCAA catabolism and showed an accentuated decrease after 90 days, leading also to lower ratios between these metabolites and the sum of all acylcarnitines.
PMC6316856	D00014	In fact, reductions in BCAA one month after RYGB correlate with improvement in glucose homeostasis _11 .
PMC6316856	D00016	The concentration of BCAA-derived AC has been positively correlated with obesity and insulin resistance in different studies and that seems to originate from an altered BCAA catabolism in adipose tissue.
PMC6316856	D00017	It seems that with their increase in circulation, BCAA become available for oxidation in liver and skeletal muscle, leading to increased concentration of the acylcarnitines derived from BCAA catabolism in obese patients [,].
PMC6316856	D00018	In the present as well in previous studies, there is a positive correlation between propionylcarnitine and glucose levels (r = 0.3) as shown in B, suggesting an interplay in utilization of BCAA and glucose.
PMC6316856	D00019	Altered changes in BCAA-derived AC after bariatric surgery suggest that the overall oxidation of BCAA is increased and associated with reduced levels of BCAA in circulation.
PMC6316856	D00020	Bile acid metabolism is crucial to cholesterol homeostasis and BA modulate metabolic processes through G protein-coupled receptor (TGR5) and nuclear receptors (FXR, LXR and others).
PMC6316856	D00021	Previous reports describe increased plasma BA concentrations in patients undergoing RYGB surgery [,] related to improvements in glucose and lipid metabolism.
PMC6316856	D00023	The activation of TGR5 receptors in colonic endocrine cells can stimulate GLP-1 secretion, improving glucose and lipid homeostasis.
PMC6316856	D00025	De Giorgi et al also showed that faster absorption of dietary triglycerides after RYGB surgery may be responsible for decreased postprandial and basal triglyceride concentrations observed in these patients.
PMC6316856	D00026	The proposed mechanisms mediating such effects involve a pronounced early peak of FGF19 and apoB48 availability associated with the BA changes, leading to faster clearance of triglycerides.
PMC6316856	D00032	Phospholipids and sphingolipids correspond to a large portion of the plasma lipidome.
PMC6316856	D00033	Plasma phospholipid concentrations are modulated by dietary and adipose tissue changes.
PMC6316856	D00034	In our study, we observed a marked decrease in the concentration of PC containing long-chain and very long-chain FAs.
PMC6316856	D00035	Forbes et al. have also shown that the content of linoleic acid (C18:2) within plasma phospholipids was decreased in patients 1 and 6 months after RYGB, presumably due to reduction of dietary fat intake [,] or due to increased FA ß-oxidation.
PMC6316856	D00036	Graessler et al found significant decrease in several phospholipids classes in plasma, including ceramides, lysoPCs, PCs and ether PCs 3 months after RYGB, without changes in SM levels.
PMC6316856	D00037	Luo P et al. found decreased PC, LysoPC species and non-esterified FA 6 and 12 months after RYGB.
PMC6316856	D00038	They also found changes in some SM species, such as an increase in SM16:0 and a decrease in SM20:0 concentration.
PMC6316856	D00040	observed increases in some sphingosines, unsaturated FAs, and phospholipids, while ceramide, triglycerides, and saturated FAs decreased following RYGB.
PMC6316856	D00041	What makes our study unique is that the phospholipids analyzed comprise not only of those found in plasma but also those in blood cell membranes and in lipoproteins; nevertheless, the reported changes go in the same direction as most of the previously published studies.
PMC6316856	D00042	Sphingomyelins amongst all metabolites analyzed correlated best with clinical parameters.
PMC6316856	D00043	Whilst the majority of SM with high VIP values displayed negative correlations, SM OH C22:1 displayed a positive correlation with total cholesterol (r = 0.59), LDL cholesterol (r = 0.51) and triglycerides (r = 0.52) levels.
PMC6316856	D00044	SM are known to be constituents of membranes of HDL particles and their accumulation decreases the fluidity of the lipid monolayer, affecting the metabolism of lipoproteins [,].
PMC6316856	D00045	Dietary sphingomyelin (SM) was shown to reduce the absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides and FAs in vitro and in rat models.
PMC6316856	D00046	Thus, changes in SM species may be secondarily related to changes in cholesterol and triglycerides homeostasis
PMC6316856	M01000	Serum glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL-cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γGT), creatinine, uric acid, vitamin D, folic acid, ferritin, c-reactive protein, thyroxin and thyroid-stimulating hormone were measured in a certified clinical laboratory, using standard protocols.
PMC6316856	M02000	In order to extract the metabolites from DBS, punches of 3 mm diameter (estimated total blood volume = 3.1 µL) were soaked in 400 µL methanol for 30 minutes under agitation at room temperature.
PMC6316856	M02001	Methanolic extracts were filtered, evaporated and ressuspended in 100 µL methanol prior to analysis.
PMC6316856	M02002	The methanol used for the extraction contained a mix of internal standards for quantitation of the acylcarnitines (Chromsystems, Gräfelfing, Germany), phospholipids and sphingolipids (Avanti Polar Lipids, AL, USA) of interest.
PMC6316856	M02003	Phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins were analyzed by mass spectrometry in FIA mode.
PMC6316856	M02005	Multiple reaction monitoring was performed using transmissions specific for each of the 76 phosphatidylcholines (PC), 18 lyso-phosphatidylcholines (L-PC) and 15 sphingomyelins (SM).
PMC6316856	M02006	The mobile phase consisted of LC-MS grade methanol:H2O (96.7:3.3) containing 5 mM NH_4 Ac, flowing at 35 uL/minute.
PMC6316856	M02008	Lyso PC a C9:0 and lyso PC a C19:0 were the internal standards used for Lyso-PC quantitation, while 3 different internal standards were used for PC quantitation in order to correct for chain length differences: PCaaC28:0, PCaaC40:0 and PCaa C46:0.
PMC6316856	M02009	Sphingomyelins were quantified using SM C6:0 as internal standard.
PMC6316856	M02010	Acylcarnitines (AC) present in DBS methanolic extracts were quantified using LC-MS/MS, following the method of Giesbertz et al..
PMC6316856	M02011	In this analysis, 23 AC were quantified after butylation, using 13 deuterated acylcarnitines (or L-carnitine) as internal standards (d9-C0, d3-C2, d3-C3, d3-C4, d9-C5, d5-C5DC, d3-C6, d3-C8, d3-C10, d3-C12, d3-C14, d3-C16 and d3-C18).
PMC6316856	M02014	In this case, the DBS methanolic extracts were mixed with a solution of deuterated internal standards, the solvent evaporated under N_2 and the residue re-suspended in 100 µL methanol:water (1:1).
PMC6316856	M02016	Bile acids were separated using a gradient with 0.2% formic acid in water and acetonitrile starting at 30% and increasing up to 100% at 10.5 minutes, with a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min.
PMC6316856	M02017	The RP column (Phenomenex Luna C18(2) 150 x 4,6 mm; 5 µm particle size) was kept at 40 °C.
PMC6316856	M02019	The solution of deuterated internal standards contained d4-Deoxycholic acid, d4-Glycoursodeoxycholic acid, d4-Glycodeoxycholic acid, d4-Glycocholic acid and d5-Taurocholic acid.
PMC6316856	R00002	The RYGB’s favorable effect on serum lipid profile was also observed: cholesterol levels decreased by approximately 21% (p < 0.0001), LDL-C by 22% (p < 0.0001) and triacylglycerol by 29% (p = 0.0003).
PMC6316856	R00003	Glucose levels decreased by 17% and HbA1c level turned from 6.57 ± 2.2 before surgery to 5.5 ± 0.8 (p = 0.02).
PMC6316856	R01000	We quantified 22 acylcarnitines (AC) species and L-carnitine in DBS samples (, Appendix).
PMC6316856	R01001	Total acylcarnitine concentration rose from 15.3 ± 0.6 µM at baseline to 19.1 ± 0.8 µM 15 days after surgery (p < 0.001)
PMC6316856	R01003	This effect was only transient as AC levels returned to initial values (14.3 ± 0.6 µM) 90 days after the procedure.
PMC6316856	R01004	The increase in AC levels observed 15 days after surgery were mainly due to acetylcarnitine (C2), hydroxybutyrylcarnitine (C4-OH) and long-chain AC species (mainly C16 and C18) - products of fatty acid (FA) catabolism.
PMC6316856	R01005	In contrast, RYGB surgery reduced the concentration of propionylcarnitine (C3) already 15 days after the procedure, and this change was still present after 90 days.
PMC6316856	R01006	Other acylcarnitines derived from branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) catabolism such as isovalerylcarnitine (3M-C4) and 2-methyl-butyrylcarnitine (2M-C4), had their concentrations decreased only 90 days after the surgery.
PMC6316856	R01007	The decrease in total BCAA-derived acylcarnitines (BCAA_AC) concentration 15 days after surgery was accentuated after 90 days with a 37% decrease (p < 0.05), leading to decreased ratios between these species and the sum of all acylcarnitines (B).

PMC6316856	R01011	(A) C2: acetylcarnitine; Total AC: sum of all quantified acylcarnitines; medium chain: sum of acylcarnitines with 6 to 14 carbons; long chain: sum of acylcarnitines with 16–18 carbons; (B) BCAA_AC: sum of acylcarnitines derived from branched-chain amino acid catabolism (C3, 2M-C3, 2M-C4, 3M-C4 and C4DC); FA_AC = sum of medium-chain acylcarnitines derived from fatty acid catabolism (C6, C8, C10, C12, C14, C16, C16:1, C:18, C18:1, C18:2; C0 = L-carnitine.
PMC6316856	R01012	Acylcarnitnies with even-carbon acyl chains ranging from C2 to C16 (as released into and measured in blood) are representative of their cognate acyl-CoA intermediates derived from FA β-oxidation.
PMC6316856	R01013	Therefore, the ratio between medium-chain (MC) and long-chain acylcarnitines (LC) may be used as an indicator of FA catabolism.
PMC6316856	R01015	The ratio between free L-carnitine (C0) and the total pool of acylcarnitines could serve as an overall indicator of the catabolic state, since carnitine is conjugated to intermediates of FA and amino acid degradation.
PMC6316856	R01016	The ratio of C0/total AC decreased by 26% at 15 days after the surgery (p < 0.001) and was still lower than before surgery at day 90, indicating a sustained increased catabolism of endogenous substrates (B).
PMC6316856	R02003	The concentration of glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) increased 54% (p < 0.05) and glycocholic acid (GCA) acid by 43%.
PMC6316856	R02004	Taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) also showed a significant increase of 57% (p < 0.05)
PMC6316856	R03000	Seventy-six different phosphatidylcholines (PC), 18 lyso-phosphatidylcholines (L-PC) and 15 sphingomyelins (SM) were quantified (, Appendix).
PMC6316856	R03001	Phosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins are the main phospholipids in mammalian plasma membranes and circulating lipoproteins.
PMC6316856	R03003	Our method allowed the quantification of ester- and ether-linked phosphatidylcholines, and although ester-linked phospholipids are more abundant, both types presented a similar response pattern to RYGB surgery.
PMC6316856	R03004	Fifteen days after surgery, the concentration of total PC decreased by 15% (p < 0.001).
PMC6316856	R03006	PC-C36 and PC-C38, which contain long-chain FA (side chain of 16 to 20 carbons), represented more than 50% of total PCs quantified and were also the individual PC species with the most pronounced decrease 15 days after the surgery, with effects lasting up to 90 days.
PMC6316856	R03007	Whole blood concentration of Phosphatidylcholines (diacyl) (A), Ether-Phosphatidylcholines (B), Lysophosphatidylcholines (C) and Sphingomyelins (D) before, 15 and 90 days after RYGB.

PMC6316856	R03012	Lysophosphatidylcholines (L-PC) result from hydrolysis of one acyl group of PC and represent intermediates in PC remodeling and synthesis.
PMC6316856	R03013	Similar to the PCs, L-PC concentrations in blood also diminished by 11% at day 15 (p < 0.01) and the effect was sustained 90 days after RYGB.
PMC6316856	R03014	The most pronounced decreased was noted in L-PC containing polyunsaturated and very long-chain FA, which decreased by 17% and 18% (p < 0.01), respectively (C).
PMC6316856	R03015	RYGB induced an opposite effect on sphingomyelins (SM) concentrations with a 10% increase 15 days after surgery (p < 0.001), with elevated levels remaining up to 90 days.
PMC6316856	R03016	This increase was observed in saturated and monounsaturated SM species, while SM containing polyunsaturated FA showed a decrease 90 days after the surgery (D).
PMC6316856	R04005	Propionylcarnitine and other BCAA-derived AC, as well as the phosphatidylcholines PCae C36:3, PCaa C36:2 and sphingomyelin SM OH C22:1 had higher concentrations in samples collected before surgery, while SM 16:0, SM 18:0, SM 18:1, the acylcarnitine 3-Hydroxybutyrylcarnitine (C4:OH) and the phosphatidylcholines PCaa C32:2 and PCae C32:1 were increased in blood collected 90 days after the RYGB surgery.
PMC6316856	R04011	Spearman’s correlation analysis between metabolites with high VIP values and parameters of clinical chemistry indicated that these metabolites significantly correlated to alterations in cholesterol, triacylglycerol and glucose plasma concentrations.
PMC6316856	R04012	SM OH-C22:1 presented the highest positive correlation (r = 0.59) with total cholesterol, while the remaining SM species showed negative correlation.
PMC6316856	R04013	A similar relationship was observed between plasma triacylglycerol levels and these SM.
PMC6316856	R04014	LDL cholesterol levels also correlated positively with SM OH-C22:1 (r = 0.51).
PMC6316856	R04015	The ether-linked phosphatidylcholine C36:3 showed a significant positive correlation with total cholesterol (r = 0.59), LDL-cholesterol (r = 0.45,) and triacylglycerol (r = 0.43,).
PMC6316856	R04016	Glucose plasma concentration was positively correlated with propionylcarnitine (r = 0.48) and with the ratio of BCAA-derived acylcarnitines (r = 0.51), but negatively correlated to SM C18:0 and SM C18:1 (r = −0.42 and −0.46, respectively).
PMC6316856	R04017	Propionylcarnitine was also significantly correlated with triacylglycerol concentrations (r = 0.40).

PMC6316856	R04026	Apart from the correlations with clinical chemistry parameters, the above-mentioned sphingomyelins (except SM OH C22:1) were negatively correlated with BCAA-derived AC and PCs containing 36 carbons, but were positively correlated with the PCs containing 32 carbons.
PMC6317696	D00008	Another study, the ‘metabo-ring’ initiative, also tested across several platforms (5 NMR and 11 LC-MS), using spiked samples and also real biological materials from a rodent study of vitamin D exposure.
PMC6317696	D00020	This suggests that specific guidance should be provided for targeted LC-MS protocols to support correct peak identification as was the case for Asn, Thr, Ac-Orn, trans- and cis-OH-Pro, carnosine and sarcosine in the manufacturer’s protocol used here.
PMC6317696	D00021	However, anecdotal evidence from the participating laboratories suggests that peak ambiguity was a problem for other metabolites for which guidance was not provided (Asp and Glu, and several biogenic amines) and that there was variability in how this was addressed at each centre.
PMC6317696	D00024	Many of metabolites that were difficult to integrate reliably from LC-MS/MS (e.g. histamine, carnosine, DOPA, Dopamine, Nitro-Tyr, c4-OH-Pro and PEA) were also present at around or just below the limits of detection.
PMC6317696	D00033	In our dataset it was necessary to normalise FIA-metabolite data in order to get acceptable inter-laboratory precision, particularly for sphingolipids.
PMC6317696	M00001	The kit allows the targeted analysis of up to 189 metabolites (see ) in the metabolite classes of amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids and sum of hexoses, covering a wide range of analytes and metabolic pathways in one targeted assay.
PMC6317696	M00007	The acylcarnitines (40), glycerophospholipids (90), sphingolipids (15) and sum of hexoses (1) are analysed by FIA-ESI-MS/MS, using a one point internal standard calibration with representative internal standards (9 isotope-labelled acylcarnitines, 1 isotope-labelled hexose, 1 non-labelled lyso-PC, 2 non-labelled PCs, 1 non-labelled SM, a total of 14 internal standards).
PMC6317696	M00008	In terms of quantification, the lipids and a subset of acylcarnitines are called “semi-quantitative” since specific standards were not commercially available and a verification of the accuracy was not possible by the manufacturer.
PMC6317696	M00009	12 acylcarnitines and the sum of hexoses are fully validated as absolutely quantitative.
PMC6317696	M01002	1 NIST standard reference material (SRM 1950, lithium heparin plasma) (x3 replicates per plate).
PMC6317696	M01006	For the other 4 individuals repeated collections with three different anticoagulants (EDTA, citrate and heparin) and serum were conducted Test Samples 07-1 to 10-4).
PMC6317696	M05002	Laboratories that used HPLC did not acquire data for sarcosine, whereas laboratories that used UHPLC did not acquire data for total-DMA.
PMC6317696	M05003	Laboratories that used Waters mass spectrometry instruments did not acquire data for four lipids (PC aa C30:2, PC aa C32:2, PC aa C38:1, SM C22:3).
PMC6317696	R00002	Two of the concentrations values were not provided (PEA and sarcosine for ‘low’ – QC1), and therefore data for these are not presented.
PMC6317696	R00003	Data for sarcosine for laboratories A, B, C and E were not acquired.
PMC6317696	R00004	Only one laboratory (D) reported further missing data (for histamine, putrescine and PEA).
PMC6317696	R00012	6 metabolites (glutamate, acetylornithine and methioninesulfoxide, cis -4-hydroxyproline (c4-OH-Pro), DOPA and dopamine) did so for the lowest concentration, while 1 metabolite (PEA) did so for the medium level, and 3 (kynurenine, lysine, ornithine) for the highest concentration only.
PMC6317696	R00013	Of the remaining 8 metabolites (sphingomyelin C18:0, dodecanoylcarnitine (C12), symmetric-dimethylarginine (SDMA), spermine, spermidine, trans -4-hydroxyproline (t-4-OH-Pro), carnosine and nitro-Tyr), with poor reproducibility for at least two concentration levels, dodecanoylcarnitine (C12) was measured at consistently higher concentrations (˜150%) for just Lab C and high accuracy and precision were observed for the other laboratories.
PMC6317696	R00014	Measurements of sphingomyelin C18:0 were precise but inaccurate by a fixed percentage within Lab A (74%), Lab B (49%) and Lab F (185%), indicating that normalisation by a single multiplicative factor could improve inter-laboratory agreement for this and potentially other FIA-detected metabolites.
PMC6317696	R00015	For SDMA, only lab B reported acceptable analytical performance; one laboratory (F) reported values ˜10-fold higher than the nominal values while for four labs the accuracy ranged between 39.2% and 230%.
PMC6317696	R00016	For DOPA all laboratories reported poor accuracy results for the low concentration, whereas for dopamine two laboratories reported poor accuracy results again for the low concentration.
PMC6317696	R00017	The poor reproducibility of the polyamines spermine, spermidine and carnosine were primarily the result of anomalously low quantities reported by laboratory D (<3% of nominal value) while for t-4-OH-Pro laboratory D reported anomalously high quantities (up to 454%) and also reported poor accuracy for nitro-Tyr (12-208%).
PMC6317696	R00018	Notably for 8 metabolites (spermine, spermidine, t-4-OH-Pro, carnosine, nitro-Tyr, Glu, c-4-OH-Pro and PEA) an apparently low reproducibility could be attributed to the poor accuracy of a single outlying laboratory (see ).
PMC6317696	R01016	For sphingolipids in particular the effect was dramatic: of a total of 300 sphingolipid inter-laboratory CVs calculated, 270 CVs were >30% before normalisation and 272 CVs <20% post normalisation.
PMC6317696	R02008	FIA-normalisation made a dramatic improvement in the reproducibility of sphingolipids measurements (median CV from 68% to 6.7%) and also made a critical difference in the reproducibility of carnitines (median CV from 34% to 12%) which were frequently below the limits of detection (BLD) or missing (48%).
PMC6317696	R02009	For the remaining FIA part of the assay we observed a very high reproducibility (after normalisation) across the overwhelming majority of the metabolites across the 20 test materials: the median inter-laboratory precision was 6.4 % for the di-acyl PCs (PC aa), 5.9 % for the alkyl-acyl PCs (PC ae), 8.1 % for the lyso PCs and 6.7 % for the sphingolipids.
PMC6317696	R02010	Laboratories that used Waters instruments did not acquire data for 4 of the lipids (PC aa C30:2, SM C22:3, PC aa C32:2, PC aa C38:1).
PMC6317696	R02011	Of these 4 lipids PC aa C30:2 and SM C22:3 also showed poor performance for some of the other laboratories and poor inter-laboratory precision.
PMC6317696	R02012	With the exceptions of aspartic acid (Asp) and glutamate (Glu) the precision of the amino acid analysis was very high (median 7.1%), with almost all of the concentration values being above the limits of detection.
PMC6317696	R02013	Of the 45 metabolites reporting at least 30% of their data missing or BLD, 26 were carnitines indicating that the typical abundances of many of these metabolites in blood serum or plasma were below the operating limits of the assay.
PMC6317696	R02014	However, mitigating this was the observation that after normalisation only 3 carnitines (C3:1, C5:1-DC, C9) produced inter-laboratory CVs>20%.
PMC6317696	R02015	Of the 5 metabolites for which missing data precluded reproducibility analysis, sarcosine was not part of the assay for 4 laboratories due to the requirement of UHPLC for measurement.
PMC6317696	R02016	Between the two laboratories that did measure sarcosine the agreement was within ~10% (data not shown).
PMC6317696	R02017	For the other four metabolites (PEA, nitro-tyrosine, cis-4-OH-Pro and dopamine) all laboratories consistently reported extensive missing data (>80% in total) indicating that in normal serum/plasma these metabolites could not be detected reliably by the assay.
PMC6317696	R02021	For carnosine, DOPA and histamine the majority of values across laboratories were reported as missing or BLD indicating that in normal serum/plasma these metabolites were not detected reliably by the assay.
PMC6317696	R02023	Methionine sulphoxide (Met-SO) was not detected in 90% of samples by Laboratory D while laboratories E & F reported high numbers of missing values.
PMC6317696	R02024	Laboratory D also reported a high proportion of BLD values (95%) for alpha amino-adipic acid (Alpha-AAA).
PMC6317696	R02025	Laboratories B, D and F did not detect one or more of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine as reliably as other laboratories.
PMC6317696	R02026	SDMA was poorly detected by Laboratory A only (55% missing values) but reported with good precision in other laboratories.
PMC6317696	R02027	Of the amino acids with low reproducibility aspartic acid (Asp) was measured with an intra-laboratory precision>20% for laboratories C and D. For the LC-MS detected metabolites only glutamic acid (Glu) and ADMA returned a high inter-laboratory CV despite typically good intra-laboratory precision and low numbers of missing samples.
PMC6317696	R03001	The overall reproducibility of serum data across all metabolites (median CV 6.9%) was marginally lower than for matched data across all laboratories generated on plasma (median CV 7.2-8.2%) with heparin plasma producing the highest values.
PMC6317696	R03003	Reproducibility measurements made on a sample from an individual with pathologically high blood lipids revealed that inter-laboratory precision was substantially worse for phospholipids including sphingomyelins, with CVs increasing by ~4-fold (to 24-26%).
PMC6317696	R03004	Increased CVs were also observed for hexoses and lyso-phosphatidylcholines (to 12.2 and 13%, respectively).
PMC6346097	A00003	Across all measured apoE- and apoB-containing lipoproteins, ε4 allele had consistently atherogenic and ε2 protective effect on particle concentrations of free/esterified cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and total lipids.
PMC6346097	A00004	As novel findings, ε4 associated with glycoprotein acetyls, LDL-diameter and isoleucine – all reported biomarkers of CAD-risk, inflammation, diabetes and total mortality.
PMC6346097	D00000	In the present study, apoE polymorphism associated consistently and as expected over the followed years with plasma concentrations of basic lipids i.e., total cholesterol, LDL-C and apoB (as widely reported in literature, including the previous YFS follow-up).
PMC6346097	D00001	However, as new information apoE ε4 allele also presented a consistent atherogenic effect across all measured apoE- (chylomicron remnants, VLDL, IDL, HDL) and apoB-containing (VLDL-, IDL-, LDL) lipoproteins along with their subfractions, showing an influence on particle concentrations of free/esterified cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and total lipid contents, as well as on LDL and VLDL particle sizes in serum.
PMC6346097	D00005	Briefly summarized, apoE polymorphism alters the hepatic binding, uptake, and catabolism of apoE- and apoB-containing lipoproteins, as well as intestinal cholesterol absorption, bile acid formation and endogenous cholesterol synthesis.
PMC6346097	D00007	In ε4 carriers these mechanisms can lead to hypercholesterolemia and pro-atherogenic circulating lipoprotein-cholesterol distributions such as more cholesterol enriched chylomicron remnants and apoB-containing lipoproteins, as well as higher VLDL-C/HDL-C ratio.
PMC6346097	D00009	Elevated membranous and cytoplasmic cholesterol levels have been demonstrated with ε4, and increased membranous phospholipids, as well as cytoplasmic cholesteryl esters and TGs have been found in apoE deficiencies – all possibly promoting various heart anomalies.
PMC6346097	D00018	  with VLDL-TG and MVLDL particle concentrations, this might be reasoned by variable metabolite trending along our follow-up period, experienced also in other reference studies such as in with serum cholesterols.
PMC6346097	D00021	However, our results are well in line with an early study of standard serum lipid profile changes, where increased TG levels were found in the ε4+ subgroup in conjunction with a weight gain.
PMC6346097	D00022	TG elevation was suggested to be caused by an increased VLDL production due to weight-gain, accompanied by retarded VLDL clearance attributable to the ε4 allele – the mechanism of which is explained deeper in a review by Phillips.
PMC6346097	D00026	More consistently, ε4 allele associated with low cholesterol of large- and medium-sized HDL-particles.
PMC6346097	D00027	However, also ε2 carriers indicated lower cholesterol levels of extremely large and small HDL-particles, as well as of HDL3 subfractions.
PMC6346097	D00028	Based on present knowledge, it may be difficult to interpret whether the cholesterol contents of different HDL subpopulations could have any predictive value.
PMC6346097	D00030	In addition, a comprehensive literature review of HDL2 and HDL3 cholesterol does not distinguish cardioprotective differences between HDL subclasses, despite prior opposite hypothesis.
PMC6346097	D00033	Nevertheless, certain variation of the HDL cholesterol profiles persisted between our apoE subgroups, assessed by multiple measurements.
PMC6346097	D00036	On the other hand, glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) is a novel biomarker of systemic inflammation, and elevated baseline circulating GlycA has been found to associate also with a future risk of CAD.
PMC6346097	D00037	In our present cross-sectional analyses in the same YFS cohort, elevated GlycA level was found in the apoE ε4+ subgroup:
PMC6346097	D00040	In addition to inflammation, GlycA has also been reported to strongly predict the short-term risk of all-cause mortality.
PMC6346097	D00041	Small LDL particle diameter has been independently linked to atherogenesis and elevated risk of CVD, as well as all-cause mortality – potentially due to decreased LDL receptor binding and longer residence time in plasma, increased permeability through the endothelial barrier, arterial proteoglycan binding and susceptibility to oxidation (e.g.).
PMC6346097	D00044	A recent review associate isoleucine (and leucine, not valine) with insulin resistance and higher blood glucose levels.
PMC6346097	D00045	Isoleucine has been previously associated with insulin resistance also in the YFS cohort follow-up of 2001–2007 – although this effect was only seen in men.
PMC6346097	D00046	In our current analyses, isoleucine was elevated by the ε4 allele in all subjects in 2001 and 2011 (see Figs  and respectively), as well as in men in 2011 (see Supplementary Fig.
PMC6346097	D00048	As mentioned in the Introduction, LDL-C as such may not have the sensitivity or specificity needed to distinguish CAD risk within all the subjects with elevated LDL-C. On the other hand, many CAD patients may have fairly normal LDL-C. One of the suggested markers for predicting better the atherogenic potential of LDL is LDL-TG – high LDL-TGs being reported to indicate cholesterol ester-depleted LDL, elevated IDL and dense LDL.
PMC6346097	D00052	And as discussed earlier, our longitudinal analyses would indicate even a growing tendency of VLDL and TG over time in the ε4 carriers (see Fig.
PMC6346097	D00067	For further work, the associations of more specifically quantified serum lipidomics data should also be analysed over the apoE genotypes, as certain TGs, cholesterol esters, PGs (phosphatidylethanolamines) and sphingomyelins (ceramides) have presented the strongest found novel associations with increased risk of CAD – in our study, elevated associations of all these lipid groups can be detected also in the apoE ε4+ subgroup (lowered in the ε2+ subgroup), and it is well expected to reveal more common nominators in the reported pool of novel risk markers.
PMC6346097	M01002	Based on questionnaires, daily smoking (yes/no), hormonal birth control of women (yes/no), cholesterol lowering medication (yes/no) and socio-economic status based on occupation (manual/lower non-manual/upper non-manual) were all tested as covariates to associate with several different metabolic levels, but to have negligible or zero effect on the apoE β-values.
PMC6346097	R01034	(VLDL, IDL, LDL) lipoproteins with an influence on particle concentrations of free/esterified cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids and total lipid contents, as well as on LDL and VLDL particle sizes.
PMC6346097	R01039	As isolated remarks on sex-stratified results, elevation of glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA) and isoleucine levels (with p < 0.05 after FDR) were found only in the apoE ε4+ group of men, in the 2011 follow-up (see Supplementary Figure _S6 ).
PMC6346097	R01043	Total cholesterol, LDL-C, as well as apoB were all elevated among the apoE ε4 allele carriers and lowered among the ε2 carriers as compared with the most common apoE ε3/3 group, in all follow-up points, as expected (data not shown here).
PMC6346097	R01044	In addition, at the end of our follow-up period in 2011 ε4 carriers expressed also elevated TG and lowered HDL-C – these two parameters did not differ statistically between the ε2 carriers and the ε3/3 group at any follow-up measurement.
PMC6346097	R03002	One missing GlycA measure in 2001 and 2007, as well as four isoleucine measures in 2001 and one in 2007 were mean value replaced.
PMC6346097	R03003	The concentrations of inflammation and all-cause mortality reflecting GlycA, as well as diabetogenic branched chain amino acid isoleucine were elevated in apoE ε4+ group.
PMC6363983	A00003	Estrogen metabolites are challenging to quantify in plasma and currently available immunoassays are non-specific.
PMC6363983	A00005	Estrogens were extracted from human plasma using solid phase extraction and derivatized using 1-(5-fluoro-2, 4-dinitrophenyl)-4-methylpiperazine (PPZ) before quaternization by methylation (“MPPZ”).

PMC6368375	R01034	The main elimination route for hippurate is the active renal tubular secretion and its disruption results in its accumulation in the blood.
PMC6368375	R01035	Hippurate is a uremic toxin that participates in the correction of metabolic acidosis by stimulating ammoniagenesis, a dominant and adaptive mechanism of proton excretion.
PMC6368375	R01036	Moreover, it interferes with several metabolic processes, such as: inhibition of glucose utilization by the kidney and muscle, modulation of fatty acid metabolism and regulation of the acid-base balance by stimulating the kidneys’ ammoniagenesis, among others, as reviewed by Dzúrik et al..
PMC6368375	R01037	Among these gut-derived metabolic compounds, changing levels of trimethylamine N-oxide in plasma and milk were also observed in HS dairy cows [, ].
PMC6368375	R01039	It might also be noted that, in addition to the production of gut-derived uremic toxins from dietary aromatic amino acids by the gastrointestinal microbiota, Phe is known to be an essential amino acid for most animals, including ruminants.
PMC6368375	R01040	It is also the precursor of Tyr, which is essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones and the levodopa neurotransmitter.
PMC6368375	R01041	Previous studies have shown a strong decrease in plasma thyroid hormones (i.e., TSH, T4 and T3) in different ruminant models [–], which means that the basal heat production may, in fact, decrease when Phe and Tyr are scarce.
PMC6368375	R01044	The drop of levodopa synthesis may be the result of the hypersecretion of its antagonist prolactin, as observed in response to HS in goats, ewes and cows.
PMC6368375	R01048	Increased concentration of 3-methyladenine in urine is associated with increased autophagy.
PMC6368375	R01051	Moreover, under negative energy balance, as commonly observed in HS animals, autophagy is an adaptive mechanism that provides biofuel from degraded macromolecules to maintain sufficient ATP production for adaptive macromolecular synthesis to survive stressful conditions.
PMC6368375	R01052	One of the end products of protein catabolism is urea.
PMC6368375	R01053	An increased concentration of urea in blood, milk and urine is commonly observed in HS dairy cows [, , , ] as a result of the strongly up-regulated pathway of nucleotides metabolism during HS.
PMC6368375	R01054	Urea excretion peaks were compared between HS and TN does, but no differences were found in our study (P = 0.48) in agreement with that previously reported by Hamzaoui et al.
PMC6368375	R01056	Thus, because cows do not have very many active sweat glands, we speculate that a greater portion of urea may be lost in the sweat of goats when compared to cows.
PMC6368375	R01057	On the other hand, the lower urinary excretion of metabolites related to vitamin metabolism (i.e. cholecalciferol, pyridoxal, β-alanine) may be a reflection of the commonly reported increased vitamin requirements of animals under thermal load.
PMC6370248	A03001	MPO associated baseline metabolites supported by all three levels of evidence were: serum glycerol, muscle alanine, proline, threonine, creatinine, AMP and pyruvate for ET, and serum lysine, phenylalanine, creatine, and muscle glycolate for HIIT.
PMC6370248	D00001	Our key findings can be summarized as follows: (i) significant and similiar improvement in MPO with ET and HIIT programs matched for total units of exercise performed; (ii) presence of considerable inter-individual response variability to both training programs; (iii) distinct baseline serum and skeletal muscle metabolic profile associated with MPO gains within each training program as well as differences between MPO high and low responders (HRE vs LRE); (iv) specific baseline metabolites associated with MPO gains such as serum glycerol, and skeletal muscle alanine, AMP, creatinine, proline, pyruvate and threonine for ET; serum lysine, phenylalanine and creatine for HIIT as well as skeletal muscle glycolate; and (v) pathways in baseline state arguably associated with MPO trainability, involved in the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates and perhaps translation processes.
PMC6370248	D00007	In case of ET, we observed higher baseline serum concentrations of glycerol and skeletal muscle alanine, proline, threonine and pyruvate in HRE compared to LRE.
PMC6370248	D00008	Glycerol is the backbone of triglyceride molecules, and its fasting blood levels are strongly influenced by adipose tissue lipolysis [, ].
PMC6370248	D00009	High blood concentrations of glycerol during endurance exercise are thought to contribute to thermoregulatory and cardiovascular physiology, attenuating dehydration and favoring better endurance performance.
PMC6370248	D00010	In TIMES, we observed consistent relationships between baseline glycerol levels and a glycerolipid metabolism pathway with MPO trainability in ET.
PMC6370248	D00011	On the other hand, we found higher baseline muscle concentrations of pyruvate in HRE.
PMC6370248	D00012	Pyruvate stands at the crossroad between cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolism and is key in the carbon flux to the citrate cycle [, ].
PMC6370248	D00013	Significant associations between baseline muscle pyruvate metabolism, citrate cycle, glycolysis pathway, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and phenylalanine metabolism with MPO trainability in ET were suggested from the metabolite profile.
PMC6370248	D00014	HRE in the ET program were also characterized by higher concentrations of alanine, threonine, proline and creatinine.
PMC6370248	D00015	Alanine, threonine and proline are blood glucose precursors as they can be converted to pyruvate or citrate cycle intermediates while creatinine is partly derived from degradation of phosphocreatine, a fast source of energy for skeletal muscle contraction.
PMC6370248	D00016	Interestingly, in the ET program, other pathways were suggested from the exploration of the baseline metabolite profile: glycine, serine and threonine metabolism; arginine and proline metabolism; taurine and hypotaurine metabolism; valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, all seemed to be contributing to MPO trainability.
PMC6370248	D00017	All three levels of evidence also provided support for the notion that higher baseline muscle AMP (adenosine monophosphate) concentration was associated with the gains in MPO, whereas the pathway analysis revealed that baseline purine metabolism and nitrogen metabolism also associated with MPO gains.
PMC6370248	D00018	AMP is derived from ATP and ADP hydrolysis.
PMC6370248	D00019	In a state of decreased energy levels (i.e., muscle contraction or fasting), AMP concentration increases activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which stimulates pathways involved in carbohydrate and fatty acid catabolism to restore ATP levels [, ].
PMC6370248	D00021	In the case of exposure to the HIIT program, the three lines of evidence indicated that higher concentrations of serum creatine and lower concentrations of serum lysine and phenylalanine as well as lower skeletal muscle glycolate were associated with higher MPO gains.
PMC6370248	D00022	Fasted serum creatine can be attributed mainly to liver synthesis from glycine, arginine and methionine.
PMC6370248	D00023	Skeletal muscle creatine is converted to phosphocreatine, which is a source of high-energy phosphate used to produce ATP.
PMC6370248	D00024	Our pathway analysis emphasized that creatine is involved in arginine and proline metabolism and the glycine, serine and threonine metabolism which were both associated with MPO gains.
PMC6370248	D00025	Previous studies have reported that increased availability of blood and skeletal muscle creatine through supplementation can improve ventilatory threshold and submaximal power output with HIIT programs [, ].
PMC6370248	D00026	Lysine is an essential amino acid converted to acetyl CoA and a precursor of carnitine, which contributes to the transportation of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria.
PMC6370248	D00027	Phenylalanine is another essential amino acid, and its flux provides some indication of whole body protein breakdown in the postabsorptive state.
PMC6370248	D00028	Previous studies have demonstrated lower plasma phenylalanine and lysine and high creatinine (derived from creatine) concentrations in healthy subjects with high CRF compared to low CRF.
PMC6370248	D00029	Here, we showed that pathways in which lysine and phenylalanine participate (such as phenylalanine tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis) were related to MPO trainability in HIIT.
PMC6370248	D00030	Glycolate is a hydroxy monocarboxylic acid anion that is oxidized to glyoxylate which is a precursor of oxalate [, ].
PMC6370248	D00031	It has been shown that the activity of the calcium dependent ATPase which activates the transport of calcium is itself inhibited by oxalate [, ].
PMC6370248	D00032	It is tempting to speculate that lower levels of glycolate may be associated with reduced inhibition of calcium dependent ATPase, perhaps contributing to CRF regulation.
PMC6370248	D00033	Furthermore, the lower skeletal muscle glycolate and its association with higher MPO gains suggested the involvement of glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathway.
PMC6370248	D00034	Although the glycolate function in skeletal muscle is largely unknown, one recent study has shown increased glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism in plantaris muscle of trained rats (5 h after last exercise training) compared to sedentary controls.
PMC6370248	D00035	Our findings suggest that MPO training response to ET is influenced by baseline metabolite levels reflecting metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids, with pyruvate playing a pivotal role.
PMC6370248	D00037	Pathway analysis revealed that there were 5 pathways derived from baseline metabolite profiling that were associated with MPO gains in both exercise programs: aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, arginine and proline metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism.
PMC6370248	D00052	Low to moderate reproducibility of the excluded metabolites were attributed mainly to spectrum areas overlapping with other metabolites or possibly to dynamic changes in fasting metabolism and ketone body metabolism.

PMC6370248	M02000	Participants were requested to remain sedentary before the MPO test and were instructed to abstain from consuming alcohol (for 48 h), caffeine (for 12 h) and food (for 3 h) before the test.
PMC6370248	M05001	Participants were instructed to refrain from exercise and alcohol consumption for the preceding 48 h from caffeine consumption for a minimum of 12 h.
PMC6370248	M05004	Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis of the dominant leg under local anaesthetic [2–3 ml of 2% lidocaine (Xylestesin)] using the percutaneous biopsy technique combined with suction.
PMC6370248	M06001	Filtered serum (250 μL) was diluted in a deuterium oxide solution (D_2 O, 99.9%; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc., USA) containing phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) and 0.5 mM TMSP-d4 (3-(trimethylsilyl)-2,2',3,3'-tetradeuteropropionic acid from Sigma-Aldrich) to a 600 uL final solution, and then transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube (Wilmad Standard Series 5 mm, Sigma-Aldrich) for immediate NMR acquisition.
PMC6370248	M06003	Briefly, muscle tissue fragments (~40 mg) were weighed, added to a cold methanol/chloroform solution (2:1 v/v, total of 2.5 mL), homogenized on ice (3 times of 30 s each, interspaced by 10 s pause) and sonicated for 3 min with a 10 s pause each minute.
PMC6370248	M06004	A cold chloroform/ultrapure water solution (1:1 v/v, a total of 2.5 mL) was then added to the samples.
PMC6370248	M06006	The upper phase containing methanol, water, and polar metabolites was collected and evaporated in a vacuum concentrator (miVac Duo Concentrator, GeneVac, UK).
PMC6370248	M06007	The remaining solid phase was rehydrated in 0.6 mL of D_2 O-containing phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4) and 0.5 mM of TMSPd4.
PMC6370248	R00001	Furthermore, for the 52 serum metabolites tested in a related pilot study of TIMES with blood samples obtained 15-min apart, ICCs and CVs were in a range of 0.79 to 1.00 and 3–23%, respectively, for all but 9 metabolites (2-Aminobutyrate , 2-Hydroxybutyrate , 2-Oxoglutarate , Acetate , Acetoacetate , Fumarate , Glucose , Methylamine and Oxypurinol ) which had ICCs below 0.75 and CVs above 25%.
PMC6370248	R01000	The ET, HIIT and CO groups were comparable for age, height, body mass, body fat percentage, body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, HR at rest, HR_MAX and estimated cardiorespiratory fitness in METS, MPO, serum metabolite concentration levels and skeletal muscle metabolite concentrations at baseline.

PMC6370248	R03001	In the ET program, baseline serum metabolite concentration levels that were correlated with the gains in MPO at r ≥ 0.2 and better included were o-acetylcarnitine, 3-hydroxybutyrate, propyleneglycol and others as summarized in .
PMC6370248	R03002	In the case of baseline skeletal muscle metabolites, alanine, glutamate, histidine, phenylalanine, proline, threonine, creatinine, glutathione, isobutyrate, 3-methylxanthine, AMP, 2-phosphoglycerate, histamine and pyruvate concentrations among others were correlated with the ET gains in MPO.
PMC6370248	R03003	In the HIIT program, the most correlated serum metabolites included lysine, asparagine, and tyrosine, while baseline skeletal muscle τ -methylhistidine and glycolate were the best correlates of the gains in MPO.
PMC6370248	R04002	For ET program, HRE presented higher baseline serum concentration levels than LRE for 3-hydroxybutyrate (P = 0.062), glycerol (P = 0.035), methylsuccinate (P = 0.041), O-acetylcarnitine (P = 0.019) as revealed by the pattern of findings summarized as effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals in .

PMC6400174	R00019	In serum, glutamine (P  < 0.001), pyrophosphate (P  < 0.001) and octulose‐1,8‐bisphosphate (P  < 0.001) significantly differed between the p‐GDM and control groups.
PMC6400174	R00020	Shikimate‐3‐phosphate (P  < 0.001), ethanolamine (P  < 0.001), 1,3‐diphosphoglycerate (P  < 0.001), N‐acetyl‐L‐alanine (P  < 0.001) and methionine (P  < 0.001) in urine were also significantly different between the groups (Table ).
PMC6400174	R00026	Among these metabolites, glutamine in serum and ethanolamine and 1,3‐diphosphoglycerate in urine showed >0.80 AUC_ROC values in the prediction model for discrimination between the p‐GDM and control groups (Table ).
PMC6400174	R00027	These results suggest that glutamine in serum, and ethanolamine and 1,3‐diphosphoglycerate in urine are candidate predictive markers for GDM (Figure ).
PMC6400174	R00031	The AUC_ROC values of glutamine in serum, and ethanolamine and 1,3‐diphosphoglycerate in urine were 0.81, 0.92 and 0.78, respectively.
PMC6400174	R00033	These pathways are associated with amino acid metabolism and the pentose phosphate pathway.
PMC6424582	A00006	Newly identified unconjugated BAs included 3α, 12β-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid, 12α-hydroxy-3-oxo-5β-cholan-24-oic acid and 3α, 7α, 12β-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid.
PMC6424582	D00000	The tri-hydroxyl BAs showed the most diversity among the detected BA species.
PMC6424582	D00001	We detected a total of 25 tri-hydroxyl BAs and at least 15 relevant oxidative or unsaturated species.
PMC6424582	D00003	DioxoTBA01 (34) and oxoTBA02 (38) were detected in individual urine samples in parallel to isoUCA (53) and UCA (58), which was consistent with the patterns for oxoDBA04 (13), UDCA (24) and isoUDCA (22).
PMC6424582	D00004	Based on these data, oxoTBA02 was tentatively identified as 7β, 12α-dihydroxy-3-oxo-5β-cholan-24-oic acid (3-dehydroUCA) and diketoTBA01 was tentatively identified as 12α-hydroxy-3,7-dioxo-5β-cholan-24-oic acid (3, 7-dioxoLCA).
PMC6424582	D00009	Based on this evidence, TBA07 (57) was eventually identified by a comparison with the commercial standard, (TRC, Cat H943480), as 3α, 7α, 12β-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid (12-epiCA).
PMC6424582	D00016	One of them was believed to be DCA-1β-ol, which has been characterized as a hydroxylated metabolite of DCA via CYP3A [,].
PMC6424582	D01003	For example, 3-dehydroUDCA (13) was semi-quantified using the calibration curve for 7-oxoLCA (15) at MRM of 389>389, 12-epiDCA (26) was semi-quantified using the calibration curve for isoDCA (27) at MRM of 391>345, and 12-epiCA (57) was semi-quantified using the calibration curve for CA (76) at MRM of 407>407.
PMC6424582	D01011	Another two patients (subject-B and -G) demonstrated a significantly elevated and different serum levels of UDCA, isoUDCA and 3-dehydroUDCA, which may be associated with an increased colonization of gut bacteria expressing HSDHs that catalyze the oxidation and epimerization of CDCA [,].
PMC6424582	D01016	Except for the unidentified 12-hydroxylated tri-hydroxyl species, TBA09, TBA10, TBA13 and TBA18, most of the highlighted BAs were the oxidized and epimerized metabolites of CDCA (UDCA, isoUDCA and 3-dehydroUDCA), CA (UCA, isoUCA, 7-oxoDCA and 3,7-dioxoLCA) and DCA (12-epiDCA and 12-oxoLCA)
PMC6424582	D02010	The free unconjugated form (Free), free one plus its aminoacyl amidates linked with either glycine or taurine (G/T+Free), free one plus its sulfates and glucuronides (Free+G/S), and the total level of each BA species were determined using the T1, T2, T3 and T4 protocol, respectively The epimerized metabolites of CA, including isoUCA, UCA and 12-epiCA, existed in the circulation mainly as the free unconjugated form and tended to be excreted in urine.
PMC6424582	D02014	On the contrary, αHCA and HDCA, the hepatic 6α-hydroxylated metabolites of CDCA and LCA, were inclined to be excreted in urine and existed in urine mainly as sulfates and/or glucuronides.
PMC6424582	M00002	Sulfatase from Helix pomatia Type H-1 (SUL-1), sulfatase from abalone entrails Type VIII (SUL-2), sulfatase from Patella vulgata Type IV (SUL-3), β-glucuronidase from Helix pomatia Type H-1 (GLU-1), β-glucuronidase from limpets (GLU-2), β-glucuronidase from Helix aspersa Type HA-4 (GLU-3), choloylglycine hydrolase from clostridium perfringens (CH), activated charcoal, sodium acetate, glacial acetic acid, and LC-MS grade methanol, acetonitrile and formic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
PMC6424582	M02000	The 5 mM stock solutions of unconjugated BAs in methanol were pooled and diluted to final concentrations of 100 μM each with methanol.
PMC6424582	M03002	The first aliquot was prepared with treatment-1 (T1), in which 150 uL sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) were added to determine the free unconjugated forms.
PMC6424582	M03004	The third aliquot was prepared with treatment-3 (T3), in which 150 uL buffer containing 50 U of SUL1 and 500 U of GLU1 were added to hydrolyze the sulfates and glucuronides.
PMC6424582	M03008	200 uL of acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid and 100 nM internal standards were added to each well.
PMC6424582	M03011	The residue was reconstituted with 50 μL of acetonitrile and 50 μL of water and then mixed by vortexing at 900 rpm for 20 min at 10 °C.
PMC6424582	M05001	The mobile phases consisted of 0.01% formic acid in water (mobile phase A) and acetonitrile (mobile phase B).
PMC6424582	M06002	Leucine enkephalin was infused via the reference probe as lockspray to ensure m/z accuracy.
PMC6424582	R00000	Quantitative enzyme-digestion protocols were developed based on the selectivity and efficacy of enzymes to digest a total of 27 standards of conjugated BAs at 1000 nM. CH (50U/50μL sample) showed a high activity (>95%) toward all the tested BA amides, while SULs (10U/50μL sample) and GLUs (50U/50μL sample) demonstrated varying activities (20–100%) toward BA sulfates and glucuronides.
PMC6424582	R00001	The cross-activities of SULs and GLUs to digest sulfates and glucuronides led to the development of T3, in which a combination of SUL1 and GLU1 was employed to investigate the overall sulfation and glucuronidation of BA species.
PMC6424582	R01002	A subtle, segmental gradient was determined to be critical for the resolution power of the tri-hydroxyl BAs eluted within the retention times of isoUCA (53) and αMCA (68).

PMC6424582	R01016	(E) Differentiation of DBA01 (12-epiDCA) and DCA from the other detected dihydroxy-BAs by the val-MRM transient of m/z 391>345.
PMC6424582	R03005	Among the 33 standards, alloLCA (02), 3-deoxyCA (32), 7, 12-dioxoLCA (36), 12-oxoCDCA (46), αMCA (68) and βMCA (71) were not detected or detected with levels under LLOQ.
PMC6424582	R04000	LCA (04) was the major mono-hydroxyl BA detected in both urine and serum.
PMC6424582	R04001	Low levels of 3-dehydroLCA (01) and isoLCA (03) were also detected in some individuals with a higher LCA level.
PMC6424582	R05000	The di-hydroxyl BAs showed much more diversity than the mono-hydroxyl species.
PMC6424582	R05004	Among them, isoUDCA, UDCA, HDCA, DBA01, DBA03, CDCA, and DCA were the major di-hydroxyl BAs detected in serum and/or urine.
PMC6424582	R05008	Because 12-oxoLCA (16) was detected with consistent levels with respect to DBA01 in individuals, we tentatively identified DBA01 as 3α, 12β-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid (12-epiDCA).
PMC6424582	R05009	The tentative identification matched well with the fragment data of 12-epiDCA retrieved in MASSBANK and was eventually confirmed by comparison to the standard prepared from 12-epiDCA methyl ester 3α-benzoate (TRC, Cat D232663).
PMC6424582	R05018	Another noteworthy case was the differentiation of oxoDBA08 (20) from 3-dehydroCDCA (19).
PMC6424582	R05019	The retention time variation of the 3-dehydroCDCA standard in runs lasting for 8 days was as narrow as 10.91±0.00 min.
PMC6424582	R05022	OxoDBA08 (20) was hypothesized to be 12α-hydroxy-3-oxo-5β-cholan-24-oic acid (3-dehydroDCA) because isoDCA (27) occurred at higher concentrations in individuals with the retention time of “3-dehydroCDCA” obviously deviated from 10.91 min.
PMC6424582	R05023	Comparison of our data with that of a commercial standard (TRC, Cat O856870) eventually confirmed the identification of 3-dehydroDCA.
PMC6424582	R05024	In the similar way, we tentatively identified oxoDBA04 (13) as 7β-hydroxy-3-oxo-5β-cholan-24-oic acid (3-dehydroUDCA) because it occurred in individuals consistently with both UDCA (24) and isoUDCA (22).
PMC6424582	R05025	The identification of 3-dehydroUDCA requires confirmation using an standard.
PMC6441305	A02000	We found that breast milk from IBD mothers showed significantly lower levels of IgA, sugar metabolite [lactose], and 2-aminobutyrate.
PMC6441305	A03000	The reduction in immunoprotective components of IBD breast milk such as sIgA and lactose theoretically may modulate the potential protective effects of breastfeeding.
PMC6441305	A03001	On the other hand, presence of higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, lactate, and succinate may predispose the offspring to an inflammatory condition or impact on the gut microbiome.
PMC6441305	A03002	Better understanding of the role of succinate in infants and its potential effects on microbiome or mucosal immunity merits further investigations.
PMC6441305	D00001	To date, several studies have explored detectable drug levels in IBD mothers’ breast milk, and the general consensus is that breastfeeding by IBD mothers is safe._, However, breastfeeding is discouraged for some medications such as methotrexate, ciclosporin, metronidazole, and ciprofloxacin.
PMC6441305	D00045	Among the milk components measured, the lactose concentration made the major contribution [> 93%] and hence may be the main driving force underlying the nursing effect.
PMC6441305	D00046	It is well known that lactose is first hydrolysed into its glucose and galactose moieties by lactase, located in the mucosa of the small intestine, which can modulate gut microbiota and immune responses during the suckling period by inducing the expression of IL-37 in colonic epithelial cells, monocytes, and macrophages.
PMC6441305	D00047	Our results demonstrated significantly decreased levels of lactose in IBD mothers’ breast milk at PP3, which suggested that the lower lactose in IBD milk could dampen the gut health of neonates by decreasing the growth of potentially beneficial bacteria and promoting potential pathobionts.
PMC6441305	D00048	Moreover, in this study we showed that succinate, a tricarboxylic acid
PMC6441305	D00050	Although initially succinate was reported to be involved in adenosine triphosphate
PMC6441305	D00052	Some studies have shown that succinate can increase expression of genes that facilitate angiogenesis, metastasis, and glycolysis, ultimately leading to tumour progression.
PMC6441305	D00053	Similar to its role in tumours, succinate can impair prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme activity in macrophages and directly or indirectly via reactive oxygen species [ROS] induce hypoxia-induced factor 1-alpha [HIF-1α] stabilisation.
PMC6441305	D00054	Thus, succinate acts as an inflammatory signal and chemokine for migration of monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells [DCs].In addition, succinate in synergy with Toll-like receptors [TLRs]-3 and 7 ligands enhances pro-inflammatory cytokine production by DCs.
PMC6441305	D00056	More importantly, succinate levels and other metabolites may modulate glucose metabolism and subsequently affect gut microbiota.
PMC6441305	D00057	For instance, a high succinate level has been reported to be associated with impaired glucose metabolism and specific modifications in the gut bacteria in obese individuals.
PMC6441305	D00058	It has also been reported that succinate promotes Clostridium difficile infection following microbiota disturbance.
PMC6441305	D00062	Subsequently succinate gets released into the circulation because of the compromised intestinal integrity, and can be detected in the milk.
PMC6441305	D00063	Therefore, the potential impact of milk succinate on modulating the gut microbiota merits further investigation and will be the focus of our future studies.
PMC6441305	D00064	Another interesting observation of our study was lower 2-aminobutyrate in breast milk of IBD mothers at PP3.
PMC6441305	D00065	There is a possibility that lipopolysaccharide [LPS] induces succinate accumulation by reduction of aminobutyric acid, which is reflected in lower 2-aminobutyrate in breast milk of IBD mothers.
PMC6441305	D00066	Thus, our observations suggest that increased succinate may enhance monocytes/macrophages and DC recruitment in the mammary glands of IBD patients, as a potential mechanism for increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in breast milk.
PMC6441305	D00070	Furthermore, we found significantly higher lactate content in breast milk of UC patients at PP3 compared with healthy subjects.
PMC6441305	D00071	Lactate, as the main metabolite of many fermented products, has been reported to be higher in faecal specimens of UC patients._, Recent reports indicate a more beneficial role for lactate, with immunomodulatory properties.
PMC6441305	D00072	Therefore, further studies are required to better understand the impact of higher lactate in breast milk on neonatal immune system and microbiome.
PMC6441305	M03002	The 160 μL supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube after centrifugation, and 40 μL of internal standard buffer containing 250 mM phosphate buffer with 5.0 mM [4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid] DSS and 10% D_2 O were added.
PMC6441305	R02002	As shown on the heatmap in , we found lactose was the most abundant compound compared with other metabolites in the breast milk, and was reduced in mothers with either CD [p = 0.04] or UC [p = 0.0002] at PP3.
PMC6441305	R02005	Heatmap data showing comparison of sugars in breast milk of HC versus IBD [B] Graph showing lactose levels in HC versus IBD breast milk samples at PP3 and PP6.

PMC6441305	R02010	[G] Graph showing changes in breast milk succinate and [H] lactate of HC versus IBD mothers are PP3 and PP6.
PMC6441305	R02015	However, at 6 months postpartum no significant difference was detected for lactose between the groups.
PMC6441305	R02017	Among the identified amino acids and derivatives, glutamate, glutamine, and guadinoacetic acid showed an increasing trend in breast milk of both healthy and IBD mothers, though no significant differences were found.
PMC6441305	R02018	Moreover, 2-aminobutyrate showed a decreasing trend in IBD compared with healthy controls at PP3, with statistical significance in UC versus healthy mothers.
PMC6441305	R02020	Moreover, the complexities of fatty acids and associated metabolites, which reﬂect the hydrolysis of triglycerides, were found to be indicative of human breast milk.
PMC6441305	R02025	The level of lactate appeared to be higher in IBD versus healthy mothers’ milk at PP3, though it reached significance only in the UC group [p = 0.0144]; however, no difference was observed between the groups at PP6.
PMC6441305	R02026	Notably, as shown in , the levels of succinate in UC milk samples was significantly higher compared with healthy mothers not only at PP3 [p = 0.0004] but also at PP6 [p = 0.0026].
PMC6441305	R02027	Although milk samples from CD mothers appeared to have higher succinate at PP3, this difference was not significant.
PMC6441305	R02028	Interestingly, succinate levels in breast milk of CD mothers only increased at PP6.
PMC6441305	R03003	Interestingly, we observed that patients on 5-ASA, regardless of the clinical presentation of IBD [CD or UC], had significantly higher levels of acetate, succinate, and caprylic acid in their breast milk compared with patients who were on biologics [–C].
PMC6441305	R03004	Of note, the difference in caprylic acid levels in breast milk of UC mothers on 5-ASA, compared with biologics, was significantly pronounced.

PMC6441305	R04014	CD, Crohn’s disease; UC, ulcerative colitis; 5-ASA, 5-aminosalicylic acid.
PMC6476004	A00007	The results showed that the pyruvate metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism were activated in colorectal polyps.
PMC6476004	A00008	And the glycolysis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were activated in CRC.
PMC6476004	A00010	In addition, we found that the rates of acetate/glycerol and lactate/citrate could be the potential biomarkers in colorectal polyp and CRC, respectively.
PMC6476004	D01001	The major abnormal metabolic pathways were the pyruvate metabolism, glycerolipid metabolism, glutamine and glutamate metabolism, and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism.
PMC6476004	D01002	Pyruvate metabolism predominates reliance on carbohydrate metabolism for ATP generation.
PMC6476004	D01003	It is also involved in carbon flux to regulate the ATP generation.
PMC6476004	D01004	Lactate and acetate are the key metabolites in the pyruvate metabolism.
PMC6476004	D01005	In our data of colorectal polyp, the level of lactate was increased and the level of acetate was decreased.
PMC6476004	D01006	The changes of these metabolites also suggested that the pyruvate metabolism was abnormal in the colorectal polyp.
PMC6476004	D01007	The glycerolipid metabolism was the anther abnormal metabolic pathway.
PMC6476004	D01008	The increased levels of lipid and PUFA and the decreased level of glycerol could also prove that the glycerolipid metabolism was abnormal in the colorectal polyp.
PMC6476004	D01009	This phenomenon suggested that the glycerolipid metabolism participates in the ATP generation.
PMC6476004	D01011	The increased level of glutamate and the decreased level of glutamine implied that the relevant oxidative stress was activated in the colorectal polyp.
PMC6476004	D01013	Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism was abnormal in polyps.
PMC6476004	D01014	The levels of alanine and aspartate were decreased in the serum of polyps.
PMC6476004	D01015	The alanine is the product of pyruvate metabolism.
PMC6476004	D01016	Aspartate is one of the important amino acids for the biosynthesis of the building block.
PMC6476004	D01018	Using the seemingly unrelated regression in the NMR data of sera, they found that the alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism was abnormal in the polyps.
PMC6476004	D02000	Comparing to the controls, the major abnormal metabolic pathways were the glycolysis; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; glutamine and glutamate metabolism; and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism.
PMC6476004	D02002	In our work, the level of lactate, which is the terminal product of glycolysis, was increased in the sera of CRC and citrate and succinate (intermediate products of the citrate cycle) were decreased.
PMC6476004	D02005	Previous studies have also found that compared with the control group, the level of lactate was significantly increased in the serum and tissue samples from CRC patients and the intermediates of citrate cycle levels were decreased [–].
PMC6476004	D02006	The levels of glycine and serine were increased in the sera of CRC, and the level of serine in CRC was even higher than that in the colorectal polyp.
PMC6476004	D02007	Serine is one of the important amino acids in cancer metabolism.
PMC6476004	D02008	Serine could be involved into the glycolysis by deriving from 3-phospho-D-glycerate, which is an intermediate of glycolysis.
PMC6476004	D02009	Serine could transform into glycine, which is associated with cancer cell proliferation.
PMC6476004	D02010	The increased levels of glycine and serine may imply that the activated glycine, serine, and threonine levels could be a feature of the metabolic pathway in the CRC.
PMC6476004	D02012	The change of metabolites (glutamine, glutamate, alanine, and aspartate) involved with these two pathways was similar to that between colorectal polyp and CRC patients.
PMC6476004	D03001	Outside of the two abnormal metabolic pathways (glutamine and glutamate metabolism and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism), the changed choline was alike between colorectal polyp and CRC.
PMC6476004	D03002	In our work, the level of choline was significantly increased in sera of colorectal polyp and CRC.
PMC6476004	D03004	However, we found that the level of N-acetyl glycoprotein was different in the colorectal polyp and CRC patients.
PMC6476004	D03005	The N-acetyl glycoprotein was increased in the sera of colorectal polyps and not significantly changed in those of the CRC.
PMC6476004	D03006	N-acetyl glycoprotein contains N-acetyl cysteine, while N-acetyl cysteine is a precursor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis.
PMC6476004	D03007	Because the level of N-acetyl glycoprotein was decreased in the serum of colorectal polyps, N-acetyl cysteine was also reduced accordingly, so that the equilibrium of oxidation and antioxidation may be disordered and then cause the body damage.
PMC6476004	D03008	The other differences in metabolites were 3-hydroxybutyrate, lipid, PUFA, glycerol, and glucose.
PMC6476004	D03009	The metabolites of 3-hydroxybutyrate, lipid, PUFA, and glycerol were involved with the glycerolipid metabolism, which was abnormal in the colorectal polyp.
PMC6476004	D03010	Glucose was involved with the glycolysis, which was abnormal in CRC.
PMC6476004	D03011	These phenomena suggested that the ATP generation from carbon flux was different between colorectal polyp and CRC.
PMC6476004	D03012	In addition, we found that 3-hydroxybutyrate was only significantly increased in the sera of CRC patients.
PMC6476004	D03013	3-Hydroxybutyrate is an end product of fatty acid β -oxidation.
PMC6476004	D03014	Its high level and lipid and glycerol low levels may suggest that the cancer cells enhanced fatty acid β -oxidation to support the energy demand of cancer cell proliferation.
PMC6476004	D04001	According to the results from the multi-ROC analysis, we found that glutamine, succinate, glycerol, aspartate, and lactate were the potential biomarkers in colorectal polyp and lactate, glycine, glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate were the potential biomarkers in CRC.
PMC6476004	D04002	Combining with the results of pathway analysis and the multi-ROC analysis, the metabolites involved with glycerolipid metabolism may become the potential biomarkers for colorectal polyps.
PMC6476004	D04004	In order to better distinguish the colorectal polyps from others, we used the rate between the acetate and glycerol (acetate/glycerol) as the discriminative mark.
PMC6476004	D04006	The rates of lactate and citrate (lactate/citrate) were deemed as the discriminative mark for distinguishing these three groups (colorectal polyp vs. control with a 0.821 AUC, colorectal polyp vs. CRC with a 0.772 AUC, and CRC vs. control with a 0.827 AUC; ).
PMC6476004	D04012	The results showed that the rates of acetate/glycerol and lactate/citrate have good discriminant abilities.

PMC6476004	D04021	The pathways of glutamine and glutamate metabolism and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism were abnormal in the colorectal polyps and CRC.
PMC6476004	D04022	The pyruvate metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism were activated in colorectal polyps.
PMC6476004	D04023	Moreover, the glycolysis and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism were activated in CRC.
PMC6476004	D04026	The diagnostic potential marks of the rates of acetate and glycerol in the colorectal polyps and the rates of lactate and citrate in CRC were found in the serum samples on the basis of the results of pathway analysis and multi-ROC analysis.

PMC6476004	R01002	The major pathways were glycolysis; glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism; glutamine and glutamate metabolism; and alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism.
PMC6476004	R02005	In the colorectal polyp data, the different metabolites of glutamine, succinate, glycerol, aspartate, and lactate were the potential biomarkers.
PMC6476004	R02006	In the CRC data, the different metabolites of lactate, glycine, glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate were the potential biomarkers.
PMC6498396	A00005	Five plasma metabolites (phenylalanine, tyrosine, 1-methylhistidine, 3-methylhistidine and LDL CH3-(CH2)n-) were identified responsible for distinguishing PSD from non-PSD subjects.
PMC6498396	D00003	In addition, a PSD-specific metabolic signature was identified, suggesting disturbance of neurotransmitter metabolism (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and oxidative stress (1-methylhistidine, 3-methylhistidine and LDL CH3-(CH2)n-) were implicated in the onset of PSD.
PMC6498396	D00008	These five metabolites are involved in 1) monoamine neurotransmitter metabolism (phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr)), and 2) oxidative stress (1-methylhistidine, 3-methylhistidine and LDL CH3-(CH2)n-).
PMC6498396	D01000	The aromatic amino acids Phe and Tyr are the biosynthetic precursors of the monoamine neurotransmitters (dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA)).
PMC6498396	D01002	Therefore, any pathophysiologic factor such as PSD that perturbs plasma levels of these amino acids and/or the branched-chain amino acids that compete for the common large neutral amino acids (LNAA) transporter at the blood–brain barrier (BBB) will change the CNS levels of the foregoing aromatic amino acids, the formation and release of monoamine neurotransmitters, and therefore brain function.
PMC6498396	D01004	Besides, tyrosine hydroxylase which catalyzes the conversion of tyrosine to dopa could be inhibited by high levels of phenylalanine.
PMC6498396	D01005	Therefore, in the present case, the increased plasma levels of Phe in PSD subjects relative to stroke patients result in decreased CNS levels of both Tyr and its downstream catecholamines (DA, NA), since the initial Tyr hydroxylation step in the catecholamine synthesis pathway is rate-limiting and thus controls the rate of catecholamine synthesis.
PMC6498396	D01006	This deduction is consistent with previous work that has found evidence of reduced brain catecholamine levels in the pathophysiology of PSD._,
PMC6498396	D02000	In this study, we observed that the levels of 1-methylhistidine and 3-methylhistidine were increased in PSD group relative to the stroke group.
PMC6498396	D02001	1-methylhistidine and 3-methylhistidine are the metabolic byproducts of two carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine)
PMC6498396	D02002	analogs: anserine (beta-alanyl-L-1-methyl-histidine) and balenine (ophidine, beta-alanyl-L-3-methylhistidine), respectively.
PMC6498396	D02003	Carnosine and its analogs are antioxidant molecules found in the brain, and have been thoroughly investigated in vivo and in vitro as free-radical scavengers and inducers of antioxidant systems in oxidative stress-related conditions, such as neurodegenerative disorders and hypoxic–ischemic injuries._, Interestingly, the level of another antioxidant marker, LDL, was also elevated in the PSD patients, which has been linked to increased production of oxygen-derived free radicals, contributing to the oxidative stress burden.
PMC6498396	M02005	To ensure pH stabilization, 200 µl of plasma was mixed with 400 µl of phosphate buffer (0.2 M Na2HPO4/0.2 M NaH2PO4, pH 7.4).
PMC6498396	M03000	All spectra were manually phased and baseline referenced to lactate resonance at δ1.33.
PMC6498396	R04002	Compared to healthy comparison subjects, the plasma of the PSD subjects were characterized by higher levels of lactate, phenylalanine, tyrosine and glucose combined with lower levels of 1-methylhistidine, 3-methylhistidine, LDL CH3-(CH2)n- lipid -CH2-CH=CH-, lipid -CH2-C=O and N-acetyl glycoprotein.
PMC6498396	R04023	Compared to stroke subjects, the plasma of PSD subjects were characterized by higher levels of 1-methylhistidine, 3-methylhistidine, LDL CH3-(CH2)n- and phenylalanine combined with lower levels of tyrosine.
PMC6498396	R04024	Functional enrichment of these differential metabolites suggests that disturbance of neurotransmitter metabolism (phenylalanine and tyrosine) and oxidative stress (1-methylhistidine, 3-methylhistidine and LDL CH3-(CH2)n-) were implicated in the onset of PSD.
PMC6507113	A00000	Equol is a product formed during the biotransformation of the naturally occurring isoflavone daidzein by intestinal bacteria.
PMC6507113	A00001	The role of equol in the prevention of several hormone‐dependent diseases such as prostate cancer and osteoporosis as well as vasomotor symptoms has been extensively investigated.
PMC6507113	A00002	Equol primarily occurs in the form of major metabolites such as glucuronides and sulfates, while intact equol has been detected at only ca.
PMC6507113	A00004	However, to date, conjugated metabolites have been evaluated by measuring the free equol obtained after selective enzymatic hydrolysis.
PMC6507113	A00005	Thus, the precise types of conjugates circulating in vivo and the position(s) of the conjugation sites on the equol skeleton have yet to be clarified.
PMC6507113	A00006	Our study describes the identification of polar equol metabolites in the plasma of 2 equol‐producers obtained at 8 hours after consuming 50 g of kinako (approximately 37 mg of daidzein).
PMC6507113	A00008	The results of the LC‐ESI‐MS/MS analysis indicated that the main conjugated metabolite in plasma was (S )‐equol‐7‐glucuronide‐4′‐sulfate along with lower amounts of 7‐ and 4′‐monoglucuronides as well as 7‐ and 4′‐monosulfates.
PMC6507113	A01000	Equol, glucuronide, identification, LC‐ESI‐MS, sulfate LC ESI MS
PMC6507113	D00000	Equol mostly exists in human plasma as its conjugated metabolites such as glucuronides and sulfates.
PMC6507113	D00001	To date, these conjugated metabolites have been quantified by measuring free equol obtained after selective enzymatic hydrolysis.
PMC6507113	D00002	Consequently, the exact types of conjugates circulating in vivo and the position(s) of the conjugation sites on the equol skeleton have not been determined.
PMC6507113	D00003	This study aims to clarify the plasma profile of equol metabolites.
PMC6507113	D00004	In order to further elucidate the plasma profile of equol metabolites, we chemically synthesized the 8 phase II metabolites of equol including E‐4′,7‐diG, E‐4′,7‐diS, E‐7G‐4′S, E‐7S‐4′G, E‐4′‐G, E‐7‐G, E‐4′‐S, and E‐7‐S. In a previous work, which aimed to understand the pharmacokinetics of isoflavone metabolites in human plasma, we chemically synthesized various isoflavone metabolites.
PMC6507113	D00005	However, because Dein‐4′‐G and Gein‐4′‐G could not be synthesized at the time, these metabolites were isolated from human urine.24 In a later study, it was found that Dein‐4′‐G′ rather than Dein‐7‐G′ was selectively formed as a by‐product of the reaction of Dein with methyl‐(2,3,4‐tri‐O ‐acetyl‐α‐D‐glucopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate) uronate toward the preparation of Dein‐4′,7‐diG′.
PMC6507113	D00008	As shown in Figure A and B, although E‐4′‐G, E‐7‐G, E‐4′‐S, and E‐7‐S could not be completely separated at the baseline of the MS/MS chromatogram, these metabolites were detected in plasma.
PMC6507113	D00009	The other metabolites could be readily separated on the MS/MS chromatogram except for E‐7G‐4′S and E‐7S‐4′G. However, E‐4′,7‐diG, E‐4′,7‐diS, and equol could not be identified in plasma.
PMC6507113	D00012	The peak corresponding to (S )‐E‐7G‐4′S in the MS/MS chromatograms of the plasma extracts of Subject 1 and Subject 2 (Figure B) was spiked with an authentic standard sample of (S )‐E‐7G‐4′S. Because labeled compounds were unavailable, determination of equol metabolites in the plasma of 2 equol‐producers obtained 8 hours after consumption of 50 g of kinako were performed by a standard addition method.
PMC6507113	D00014	There were also lower amounts of E‐7‐G (24 and 34%), E‐7‐S (21 and 4%), E‐4′‐S (9 and 2%), and E‐4′‐G (9 and 3%) for Subjects 1 and 2, respectively (Figure ).
PMC6507113	D00015	The difference in total amount of plasma metabolites between the 2 equol producers was significant.
PMC6507113	D00016	Specifically, the total amount of conjugated metabolites of equol in plasma samples from Subject 1 and Subject 2 were 0.33 and 0.08 μmol/L, respectively.
PMC6507113	D00017	This significant difference between the 2 equol producers may suggest a variation in the equol producing ability for biotransforming Dein into equol.
PMC6507113	D00018	Based on several previous reports, the main equol metabolite in human plasma is glucuronidated at the 7‐position of the equol ring.
PMC6507113	D00019	The presence of several equol conjugated metabolites in human plasma has been reported in the literature.
PMC6507113	D00020	Gardana and Simonetti29 identified the main metabolite of equol in the plasma of 12 female subjects as E‐7‐G by performing cochromatography with an authentic standard, while double conjugated metabolites such as diG, diS, and sulfate‐glucuronide were not found.
PMC6507113	D00021	E‐7‐G was also described as the major metabolite produced by human pooled liver microsomes, while E‐4′‐G was not detected.30 Our data also shows that E‐7‐G and E‐7G‐4′S, generated by sulfonation at the 4′ position of E‐7‐G, are the main metabolites.
PMC6507113	D00024	Therefore, the difference in the main equol metabolites by sulfonation at the 4′ position of E‐7‐G may be a result of the age difference and/or human race specificity.
PMC6507113	D00026	Interestingly, the ratio of E‐4′‐G to E‐4′‐S in Subject 2 was very small (3 and 2%), while the corresponding ratio in Subject 1 was higher (9 and 9%).
PMC6507113	D00031	Dein, Gein, and equol were conjugated by UDP‐glucuronosyltransferase (UGTs)‐mediated glucuronidation and sulfotransferase (SULTs)‐mediated sulfonation.32, 33, 34 UGTs and SULTs are present as multiple isoforms.
PMC6507113	D00032	There is a paucity of literature reports on the regioselective glucuronidation and sulfonation of equol.
PMC6507113	D00033	Nonetheless, the 4′‐glucuronidation of Dein can be performed by UGT 1A10 contributing to the first‐pass effect in the human small intestine.35, 36
PMC6507113	D00034	However, in the human liver the 4′‐ and 7‐glucuronidation are performed by UGT 1A1 and 1A9, respectively.30, 37 The SULTs responsible for the sulfonation of Dein and Gein are mainly SULT 1A1 for monosulfation at the 4′‐ or 7 ‐position and SULT 1E1 for disulfation at both positions.26 Expression and function of these enzymes may be influenced by factors such as age, race, genetic polymorphisms, and gender.38, 39
PMC6507113	D00035	Although the reason for the different occurrence of E‐7G‐4′S and E‐7S‐4′G as metabolites in human plasma is unclear, the data collected in this study on the plasma profile of equol producers will furnish useful information on the metabolism and disposition of phase II metabolites.
PMC6507113	D00036	As we investigated only 2 equol producers, therefore, a larger number of volunteers are needed to clarify the profile of the conjugated metabolites.

PMC6528156	A00001	Thus, our objective was to analyze nicotine metabolism in adults with and without type 2 diabetes who smoke.
PMC6528156	A01000	From an existing cross-sectional study, we analyzed nicotine metabolism in urine of 148 smokers, 36 type 2 diabetics (insulin or antidiabetic medication use and/or fasting glucose >126 mg/dL) and 112 non-diabetics.

PMC6528156	A02001	We found no significant difference in total nicotine equivalents defined as the sum of the nicotine, COT, and 3HC (p > .05).
PMC6528156	A03000	From these data, we infer that type 2 diabetics metabolize nicotine faster, which may increase the potential for nicotine addiction.
PMC6528156	A04001	Individuals with faster metabolism of nicotine tend to smoke more cigarettes for longer periods of time.
PMC6528156	A04002	People with type 2 diabetes may metabolize nicotine faster, which could lead to higher lifetime tobacco burden, increasing the adverse health outcomes associated with increased exposure to tobacco.
PMC6528156	D00000	In this cross-sectional study, type 2 diabetes was associated with faster metabolism of nicotine (assessed by NMR) in both unadjusted and multivariable analysis.
PMC6528156	D00001	Modeling showed traditional confounders of NMR, including age, race, and sex, as well as a potential confounder—CPD did not significantly attenuate the association between faster metabolism of nicotine and diabetes.
PMC6528156	D00004	“Fast metabolizers” of nicotine smoke more cigarettes and quit less_, ; increased exposure to nicotine often leads to increased rates of addiction and creates an overall increase in lifetime tobacco burden.
PMC6528156	D00008	Increased rates of nicotine metabolism are associated with greater reward for nicotine and worse outcomes for smoking cessation with a nicotine patch.
PMC6528156	D00010	For individuals with high NMR, smoking cessation therapy may be enhanced by tailoring treatment based on rates of nicotine metabolism.
PMC6528156	D00011	Thus, in adults with type 2 diabetes, smoking cessation may be better achieved with a combination of pharmacological therapies (ie, varenicline and nicotine replacement together).

PMC6547308	D00005	The insulin sensitivity indices of obese children with liver disease are marked by higher postprandial glucose and insulin, higher insulin/glucose ratio and higher HOMA-IR than those with no liver disease.
PMC6547308	D00007	The steroidal disease signature is marked by low urinary DHEA (, ) and its metabolites, higher glucocorticoid metabolites, due to increased glucocorticoid production rate, and lower mineralocorticoid metabolites.
PMC6547308	D00008	It is characterized by derangement of the cortisol/cortisone shuttle generated by 11β hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) type 1, as is evident from the lower (THF + αTHF)/THE ratio, enhanced 3βHSD activity ((THE + THF + αTHF)/5PT-17α ratio) and enhanced 21-hydroxylase activity ((THE + THF + αTHF)/PT).
PMC6547308	D00009	These findings may suggest lesser hepatic recycling (reduction) of cortisone to cortisol in liver steatosis, which is compensated for by increased adrenal cortisol generation and further metabolic consequences resulting from higher glucocorticoids concentrations – this mechanism results in a model of a vicious circle.
PMC6547308	D00010	Therefore, it is not surprising that higher tetrahydrocortisone concentration in L1 patients corresponds with unfavorable biochemical profile: higher triglycerides and insulin resistance.

PMC6568258	D00003	In this study, HILIC-QTOF MS-based serum metabolomics revealed patients with WD can be distinguished from healthy subjects based on metabolites associated with aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, the TCA cycle, and choline metabolism, and metabolites related to gut microbiota.
PMC6568258	D00008	Among the increased annotated metabolites, sorbitol was augmented more than 3-fold in WD.
PMC6568258	D00009	Sorbitol is a sugar alcohol and plays an important role in the polyol pathway.
PMC6568258	D00010	Underlying mechanisms for the higher sorbitol are unknown, but it might be associated with glucose metabolism.
PMC6568258	D00011	Excess copper accumulation has long been reported to inhibit glycolysis and some of its enzymes, theoretically resulting in cytoplasmic accumulation of excess glucose.
PMC6568258	D00012	Removal of glucose from the cell, mediated by the polyol pathway, could cause an increased release of sorbitol into the bloodstream.
PMC6568258	D00013	Previous studies in diabetes have also indicated that impaired glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling induces sorbitol accumulation via polyol pathways (; ; ) and there is evidence showing a positive correlation between blood copper level and risk for developing diabetes mellitus, possibly due to augmented copper-induced oxidative stress.
PMC6568258	D00014	Our analysis confirmed a previous finding in Atp7b_−/− mice, a mouse model of WD, of higher plasma sorbitol levels .
PMC6568258	D00016	Furthermore, glucose is converted to pyruvate during glycolysis.
PMC6568258	D00017	Pyruvate enters the mitochondrion where it is converted into acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH).
PMC6568258	D00018	Since excess copper leads to copper-induced oxidative stress, which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) known to inhibit PDH, excess pyruvate may accumulate and be converted to sorbitol.
PMC6568258	D00019	In diabetes, sorbitol can also lead to increased production of mitochondrial superoxide anion radicals causing poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase activation which has been reported to exacerbate oxidative stress further through generation of ROS and reactive nitrogen species (; ).
PMC6568258	D00020	Sorbitol has also been shown to have a strong copper-chelating action, thus high sorbitol levels in WD patients could help maintain cellular homeostasis by attempting chelation of excess copper.

PMC6568258	D00024	In particular, glutamic acid and α-ketoglutarate were both found to be increased in WD.
PMC6568258	D00025	α-ketoglutarate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle interconvertible with glutamic acid by transamination; therefore, glutamic acid can directly impact energy metabolism via the TCA cycle (; ).
PMC6568258	D00026	Copper-induced ROS was shown to block the TCA cycle by inhibiting α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, which converts α-ketoglutarate to succinyl CoA, with a consequent increase in α-ketoglutarate levels.
PMC6568258	D00027	The elevated glutamic acid levels observed in WD patients are likely due to conversion from the increased α-ketoglutarate.
PMC6568258	D00028	Our data showing high glutamic acid levels is consistent with previously published data indicating that copper-induced oxidative stress might be responsible for elevated glutamic acid and cytokines.
PMC6568258	D00029	Copper, then, may have duo impact on the TCA cycle through oxidative stress affecting both α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and glutamic acid.
PMC6568258	D00030	Metabolites in GSH biosynthesis and methionine metabolism e.g., cysteine, 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, and oxoproline, were significantly different in WD.
PMC6568258	D00031	Cysteine was reduced more than 2-fold in patients with WD.
PMC6568258	D00032	Cysteine functions as an antioxidant; clinical studies have shown cysteine supplementation improves skeletal muscle and immune system functions by reducing plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor α, decreasing body fat vs. lean body mass, and increasing plasma albumin levels.
PMC6568258	D00033	N-acetyl-cysteine, a derivative of cysteine, is used in the treatment of alcoholic hepatitis and acetaminophen poisoning.
PMC6568258	D00034	Cysteine is also a primary component in GSH production, a critical antioxidant against oxidative stress, particularly in the liver.
PMC6568258	D00035	In a mouse model with a hepatocyte-specific deletion in the glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit gene, causing impaired hepatic GSH production, mice became moribund by about 4 weeks of age.
PMC6568258	D00037	Previous studies by us and others showed copper accumulation is associated with reduced S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase expression and activity (; ), possibly leading to reduced cysteine and GSH levels with consequent compromised antioxidant defense.
PMC6568258	D00038	This may explain the reduced plasma cysteine observed in this study and previous reports of significantly low hepatic GSH in WD patients.
PMC6568258	D00039	Orally administered cysteine can also act as a copper chelator by forming a copper-cysteine complex, thereby inhibiting copper absorption in the gut.
PMC6568258	D00040	In untreated patients with WD, high plasma copper levels were shown to inhibit L-cysteine/L-cystine uptake in erythrocytes and GSH concentration was found to be reduced and significantly dependent on the L-cysteine/L-cystine uptake.
PMC6568258	D00041	Excess copper, then, can reduce cysteine bioavailability which may lead to increased cysteine demand.
PMC6568258	D00042	2-hydroxybutanoic acid (2-HBA) is derived from α-ketobutyrate as a byproduct of GSH anabolism when cystathionine is converted to cysteine.
PMC6568258	D00043	Elevated levels of 2-HBA serves as an early indicator for insulin resistance and compromised glucose regulation, and seems to be derived via increased lipid oxidation and oxidative stress.
PMC6568258	D00044	2-HBA is primarily produced in the liver upon excessive demand for GSH under increased oxidative stress.
PMC6568258	D00045	In the WD hepatic phenotype, therefore, copper-induced oxidative stress and reduced cysteine levels might be possible underlying mechanisms involved in up-regulation of 2-HBA.
PMC6568258	D00046	Oxoproline, reduced 1.5-fold in WD, is another metabolite involved with GSH biosynthesis and is converted to glutamate by 5-oxoprolinase.
PMC6568258	D00047	Previous studies have suggested 5-oxoproline levels indicate the availability of glycine and/or cysteine.
PMC6568258	D00048	Low levels of oxoproline may be a consequence of reduced cysteine levels in WD.
PMC6568258	D00051	They are required for functional enzymes involved in the TCA cycle e.g., succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase, and respiratory chain complexes I–III as well as for amino acid biosynthesis, including cysteine and glutamate.
PMC6568258	D00055	Moreover, previous studies in E. coli revealed copper overload inactivated ISC enzymes such as isopropyl malate dehydratase, fumarase A, and 6-phospho-gluconate dehydratase.
PMC6568258	D00057	This could lead to a deleterious cascade in which cysteine and glutamic acid levels and subsequent glutathione levels in WD patients are decreased.
PMC6568258	D00058	Since cysteine is also a required component of assembly proteins that form ISCs, reduced cysteine levels can further compound ISC damage as glutathione is required for maturation of cytosolic ISC proteins thus creating a continuously detrimental cycle of ISC/amino acid/glutathione damage and reduction.
PMC6568258	D00059	Our study revealed threonic acid was reduced more than 3-fold in serum of patients with WD.
PMC6568258	D00060	Threonic acid is a breakdown product of ascorbic acid (AA) metabolism.
PMC6568258	D00061	This metabolite is linked with the insufficiency or deprivation of AA which scavenges free radicals such as oxygen, superoxide, and hydroxyl radicals (; ).
PMC6568258	D00062	Previous reports described significant AA reduction and compromised antioxidant defense in untreated WD patients (; ), and linked copper-mediated oxidative stress to mitochondrial dysfunction.
PMC6568258	D00063	AA accumulates in mitochondria as a protective agent where most free radicals are produced.
PMC6568258	D00064	If increased oxidative stress in WD mitochondria is a valid inference, increased AA utilization should initially elevate threonic acid until AA levels are depleted, at which point the threonic acid level would decrease.
PMC6568258	D00065	Uric acid levels were reduced in WD neurologic vs. healthy subjects.
PMC6568258	D00066	Low plasma uric acid levels at presentation with hepatic or neurologic manifestations in patients with WD have been previously described and may be due to renal tubular failure and reduced uric acid synthesis in the liver (; ; ; ).
PMC6568258	D00067	Reduced levels of uric acid were also associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s disease.
PMC6568258	D00068	Uric acid acts as a natural antioxidant and low serum uric acid likely indicates, again, reduced antioxidant defense in WD.
PMC6568258	D00069	We found reduced uridine in WD hepatic compared to healthy subjects.
PMC6568258	D00070	Uridine plays many important roles in hepatic metabolism, including liver detoxification, immune homeostasis, enhancement of mitochondrial function, and suppression of fat accumulation; however, the exact mechanisms regulating its protective roles are unknown.
PMC6568258	D00071	As liver controls the formation and degradation of uridine, hepatic copper-induced liver damage in WD patients might be causatively associated with low uridine levels.
PMC6568258	D00072	An additional novel finding is reduced indole-3-proprionic acid (IPA) levels in our patients with WD.
PMC6568258	D00073	In the human gastrointestinal microbiome, IPA is endogenously produced and detected in vivo only in the presence of Clostridium sporogenes .
PMC6568258	D00074	By using tryptophan, C. sporogenes synthesizes indole and, subsequently, IPA at detectable levels in the host plasma.
PMC6568258	D00075	IPA plays a role in fibrosis and inflammatory-related gene suppression in proximal tubular cells and protects hepatic microsomal membranes from iron-induced oxidative damage in cancer.
PMC6568258	D00076	Human hepatocytes cultured with IPA also demonstrated attenuated copper- and arsenic-mediated mitochondrial and cellular DNA damage.
PMC6568258	D00077	Considering its multiple protective roles, low IPA levels indicate yet another facet of compromised cellular defense in WD.
PMC6568258	D00084	The profile of different subtypes of NASH patients included different levels of amino acids (methionine, glutamic acid, taurine, aspartic acid, and glutamine), bile acids, fatty acids, triglycerides, glycerophospholipids, and sphingomyelins.
PMC6568258	D00086	One of the studies described two bile acids, three long-chain acylcarnitines, seven glycerophospholipids, a bilirubin, and a retinyl ester as being associated with early autoimmune hepatitis.
PMC6568258	D00087	The second study showed that autoimmune hepatitis was associated with changes in metabolites typically associated with changes in energy metabolism, including pyruvate, lactate, acetate, acetoacetate, and glucose.
PMC6568258	R00008	These metabolites included amino acids associated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (glutamic acid and α-ketoglutarate) and choline metabolism (cysteine), and metabolites related to the gut microbiota (indole-2-propionic acid, glucose, and glutamine).
PMC6568258	R00009	Glutamic acid, sorbitol, pseudo-uridine, and threonic acid exhibited changes greater than 2-fold between WD and healthy subjects.
PMC6568258	R01002	Twenty-one of the 67 metabolites between healthy and hepatic were unique, including 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, 2-ketoisocaproic acid, α-ketoglutarate, glycerol-alpha-phosphate, oxamic acid, urea, and uridine.
PMC6568258	R01003	Eleven unique metabolites were identified between healthy and neurologic, including pyrophosphate and uric acid (, ).
PMC6568258	R03004	For our discussion, we selected metabolites involved in major biophysiological pathways such as the TCA cycle, methionine metabolism, and glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis.

PMC6572761	R03021	The structure of acyl side chains for all lipids was identified from MS/MS spectra._, This structural information is very important since classes of fatty acids have different biological roles, for example n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic and arachidonic acid, respectively, have anti- and pro-inflammatory properties.

PMC6572761	R07016	Among these, abundance with age was higher for 4 Cer, 5 SM, 8 FFA, 6 CE and free cholesterol, but lower for 14 PCO-, 3 PE, 2 PI and 6 LPE.
PMC6572761	R07017	For fatty acyl side chains, abundances were higher with age for C22:5 (2), C20:5 (2) and C22:4, but lower for C18:2 (44) and C20:4 (4).
PMC6572761	R07021	Significant associations were found for the following lipid subclasses for (i) sex: di- and triacylglycerols, ceramides, PE, PI and Glc/Gal-Cer, and for their fatty acyl side chains: C18:2, C20:5, C22:4 and C22:6, and (ii) age: diacylglycerols, SM, PCO-, PE, PI, LPE and for their fatty acyl side chains C18:2 and C22:5.
PMC6572761	R07028	Using WGCNA, we identified 10 modules that were strongly correlated with sex containing predominantly the same lipid subclasses as those found with strategy 1 and 2, namely di- and triacylglycerols (modules 3 and 11); SM (modules 5, 14 and 22), PCO- (module 17), PE (module 18), Cer (module 6), FFA (module 21) and the C22:6 fatty acyl side chain (module 15).
PMC6572761	R07029	Modules that correlated the most with age contained also di- and triacylglycerols (module 11), SM (module 5), PCO- (module 17), PE (module 18), PC and PI (modules 8 & 12).
PMC6572761	R07036	Nevertheless, our results corroborate the fact that lipids of various classes containing a fatty acyl side chain of the n-3 series such as C22:6 and C20:5 are significantly more abundant in females vs. those of the n -6 series such as C18:2, C20:4 and C22:4 that are more abundant in males.
PMC6572761	R07040	(cohort of 71 healthy Caucasians), except for diacylglycerols, for which higher levels were not reported in males.
PMC6572761	R07041	Interestingly, although 18 individual SM were more abundant in females using strategy 1, when all grouped as a class, it was not correlated to sex (R_2 =−0.18, P- value=0.1; strategy 2).
PMC6572761	R07042	There was, however, a better correlation, both negative and positive, for sex with modules containing SM (modules 5 & 14: R_2 = −0.27 & −0.32; P- value=0.009 & 0.0016, module 22: R_2 =0.23, P- value=0.026).
PMC6572761	R07043	Hence, these results suggest that some, but not all, SM are associated with sex.
PMC6572761	R07044	In this regard, Mielke et al. have emphasized the importance of measuring SM individually, along with their carbon-chain length instead of measuring total SM as a class, to distinguish their cellular functions since SM metabolism is highly compartmentalized.
PMC6572761	R07048	Strategy 2 (testing associations between pre-defined lipid subgroups and a selected variable) is attractive for its biological relevance, but needs accurate annotation of features and is likely to miss important information on the differential impact of a given condition (i.e. sex or age in this study) within a given lipid subgroup, as it was illustrated in this study for the impact of sex on SM.
PMC6572761	R07052	For example, in this study, module 15 contained lipids from various subclasses with a C22:6 fatty acyl side chain; this module was strongly associated with sex.
PMC6572761	R07056	For example, in this study we found that some modules containing SM correlated more strongly with sex than others.
PMC6572761	R07057	While the biological basis for this result remains to be investigated, this could suggest that sex impacts only a subgroup of SM.
PMC6572761	R08002	Using MS/MS analysis, we have ascertained the identity of 25 of these lipids, selected for representing subclasses in the whole dataset (8 PC, 6 SM, 4 TG, 3 PE, 2 Cer, 1 diacylglycerol (DG), 1 glucose/galactose (Glc/Gal)-Cer), except for a misidentification of the fatty acyl side chain composition for 1 SM.
PMC6572761	R10002	Among these, higher values were found for 40 glycerolipids, 10 ceramides, 7 PC and 4 PC plasmalogens (PCO-) in males vs. 18 SM, 18 PC, 5 PE, 2 PI, 15 LPC and 3 FFA in females.

PMC6572761	R13006	Hence, additional LC-MS analyses would be required to include lipid (sub)categories present at lower concentration such as isoprostanes and prostaglandins using separate samples that have been processed through pre-fractionation steps._,
PMC6589329	D00004	However, the triglyceride levels, HbA1c, and blood glucose levels were significantly higher in the OW group.
PMC6589329	D00010	Results show elevated lipids and glucose levels occurring in the OW group.
PMC6589329	D00015	Triglyceride accumulation in the liver and insulin resistance will activate VLDL overproduction.
PMC6589329	D00016	High VLDL released from the liver will result in higher LDLs, and from triglycerides and cholesterol ester exchanges taking place between VLDL and LDL via the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP)-mediated pathways.
PMC6589329	D00021	H There is a significant relationship of glucose with all of lipids evident from the NMR study.
PMC6589329	D00022	CH_2 and CH_3 lipids show correlation with glucose, however CH_2 –CH= lipids do not.
PMC6589329	D00024	The CH_2 lipids also show moderate correlation (r = 0.512) with blood triglycerides, which can be explained by the fact that CH_2 is also included in the lipid signal arising from triglycerides in the blood.
PMC6589329	D00028	Choline is an essential nutrient for maintaining cells and the mitochondrial membrane.
PMC6589329	D00029	Various studies have found that choline is associated with obesity.
PMC6589329	D00030	Furthermore, choline also can be phosphorylated to phosphatidylcholine which is an important metabolite for transporting LDL, and serves as an intermediary to maintain a balance between fat in the liver and plasma.
PMC6589329	D00031	The alteration of choline in OW group may suggest a modification of lipid metabolism taking place (; ).
PMC6589329	D00032	However, Alanine levels remained the same in both groups.
PMC6589329	D00033	Higher total glucose (α and β glucose) in the OW group is also remarked.
PMC6589329	D00035	Elevated lactate was also found in this study, which are metabolites that are associated with the gluconeogenesis process.
PMC6589329	D00036	Metabolomic studies on obese subjects have found higher levels of lactate in the blood.
PMC6589329	D00037	This may indicate an increased anaerobic metabolism and glucose production as lactate is a precursor of gluconeogenesis.
PMC6589329	D00038	The combination of evaluated levels of both glucose and lactate in serum may be a sign of pyruvate-dehydrogenase pathway and liver function that is associated with blood lipid impairment in the obese.
PMC6589329	M00014	The blood samples were tested for total cholesterol, high density lipoproteins (HDLs), very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), triglycerides, blood glucose, and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).
PMC6589329	M00016	Dyslipidemia was determined according to guidelines set by the national cholesterol education project adult treatment panel III with cholesterol ≥ 200 mg/dL, triglyceride ≥ 150 mg/dL, LDL ≥ 130 mg/dL, and HDL ≤ 40 mg/dL. Normal blood glucose level should be between 70 and 100 mg/dL, pre-diabetes is defined by 100–125 mg/dL. Normal HbA1c levels being lower than 6%.
PMC6589329	M00025	The base line and phase were manually corrected and referenced to internal lactate peaks at 4.12 ppm.
PMC6589329	R00007	NMR spectrum showed nine distinguishing metabolites: CH_3 lipids, CH_2 lipids, lactate, alanine, CH_2 –CH= lipids, creatine, choline, α-glucose, and β-glucose.
PMC6589329	R00010	Additionally, α-glucose and β-glucose were calculated into total glucose.
PMC6589329	R00013	The spectrum from the overweight group show slightly higher lipids, α-glucose and β-glucose, control group (purple line), and overweight group (OW, orange line).
PMC6589329	R00014	Lipids and glucose were calculated, and the results demonstrated that both total lipid and glucose were higher in the OW group.
PMC6589329	R00016	The metabolite quantification results of OW group showed higher α, β-glucose at 5.22, and 4.63 ppm with higher level lipids occurring at 0.9, 1.3, and 2.0 ppm.
PMC6589329	R00018	However, creatine at 3.03 ppm was not found in all cases, therefore creatine was excluded from any further statistical analysis.
PMC6589329	R00023	The significantly higher CH_2 lipids, CH_3 lipids, and total lipids were consistent with biochemical analysis of blood that also showed significantly higher triglyceride in the OW group.
PMC6589329	R00028	H Note: HbA1c, glycated hemoglobin; TC, total cholesterol; LDL, low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; r , Pearson correlation coefficient.
PMC6617423	A00009	Of those, the 5 metabolites phosphatidyl choline (15:0/16:0), phosphatidyl glycerol (12:0/13:0), actosylceramide (d18:1/16:0), D-Maltose, and phthalic acid, with an area under the curve above 0.75, were identified as potential biomarkers.
PMC6617423	D00006	Five metabolites, namely PC (15:0/16:0), PG (12:0/13:0), LacCer (d18:1/16:0), D-Maltose, and PA, were identified as potential biomarkers for predicting outcomes and monitoring prognosis of patients with CSCC, as their combined AUCs were sufficient to distinguish the subjects among the 3 groups.
PMC6617423	D00008	Phospholipids are a key component of the cell membrane and one of the most widely distributed bioactive substances in the body.
PMC6617423	D00010	The main biological functions of PC (15:0/16:0) include storing energy, protecting the liver, increasing high-density lipoprotein levels, and restoring vascular elasticity.
PMC6617423	D00011	Endogenous PC can produce arachidonic acid (AA) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) through deacylation promoted by the cytosolic phospholipase A_2 (cPLA_2 ).
PMC6617423	D00012	Previous studies showed that AA and its downstream mediators have a role in promoting tumor cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis.
PMC6617423	D00013	Lysophosphatidic acid produced from LPC by lysophospholipase D also plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation.
PMC6617423	D00014	In this study, the level of PC (15:0/16:0) was highest in the GP group, followed by BT and PP.
PMC6617423	D00015	This may be because endogenous PC in patients with primary and recurrent CSCC is converted to AA and LPC by cPLA_2 , resulting in the decrease of the PC level itself.
PMC6617423	D00017	We found that the level of PG (12:0/13:0) was highest in the BT group, followed by PP and GP.
PMC6617423	D00018	PG is a small molecular phospholipid; it primarily exists in the cell membrane and is essential for the synthesis of cardiolipin.
PMC6617423	D00019	Recent studies revealed that eukaryotic mitochondria contain 2 independent pools of PG, which are mainly distributed in the phospholipid bimolecular structure of the inner and outer membranes of the mitochondria.
PMC6617423	D00021	In this study, the LacCer (d18:1/16:0) level was highest in the BT group, followed by GP and being lowest in PP.
PMC6617423	D00022	It was shown that LacCer is specific and highly expressed in cell lines of breast cancer, but it is not related to recurrence; these findings are similar to ours.
PMC6617423	D00023	LacCer synthase is activated by pro-inflammatory factors to generate LacCer, which in turn activates “oxygen-sensitive” signaling pathways that affect cellular processes, such as proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis.
PMC6617423	D00025	However, the reason why LacCer (d18:1/16:0) level does not increase in patients with recurrence remains to be elucidated.
PMC6617423	D00026	Regarding the level of maltose, it was highest in the BT group, followed by PP and GP; this trend might be associated with tumor formation and recurrence.
PMC6617423	D00027	Due to the lack of maltase activity in the blood, maltose is mainly transported to the kidney by the maltose-binding protein (MBP), where it is hydrolyzed to glucose by maltase to be reabsorbed into the body.
PMC6617423	D00029	According to our findings, we hypothesized the MBP and its metabolic pathways are inhibited in tumor cells, thus affecting the transport of maltose.
PMC6617423	D00031	Phthalic acid esters (PAEs), as common environmental endocrine disruptors, can enter the body through the respiratory system and skin, interfering with the endocrine system.
PMC6617423	D00032	Additionally, PA is a PAE metabolite with mutagenicity and carcinogenicity potential.
PMC6617423	D00033	In agreement, we observed that PA had the highest level in the BT group, followed by PP, and being lowest in GP.
PMC6617423	D00034	This trend also suggests that PA promotes the development of CSCC.
PMC6617423	M03000	After thawing the plasma sample at room temperature, 80 μL were transferred into a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube and mixed with 10 μL of internal standard (0.3 mg/ml; L-2-chlorophenylalanine) by vortexing 10 s. Subsequently, 240 μL of the protein precipitation [methanol/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v)] were added, and the mixture was vortexed again for 1 minute.
PMC6617423	M04001	The mobile phase was a mixture of water containing 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid (B).
PMC6617423	R05000	A total of 31 metabolites were significantly different among BT, PP, and PP groups (Fig. ), including glycerophospholipid, sphingomyelin, and glycosphingolipid.
PMC6617423	R05002	The results of the ROC analysis showed that the AUCs of 5 specific metabolites, namely phosphatidyl choline [PC (15:0/16:0)], phosphatidyl glycerol [PG (12:0/13:0)], lactosylceramide [LacCer (d18:1/16:0)], D-Maltose, and phthalic acid (PA), were above 0.75.
PMC6617423	R05006	The levels of PA, D-Maltose, and PG (12:0/13:0) were highest in BT group, followed by PP group, and finally GP group.
PMC6617423	R05007	The level of LacCer (d18:1/16:0) was also highest in the group, but decreased in GP group PP group.
PMC6617423	R05008	The level of PC (15:0/16:0) was highest in GP group and lowest in PP group.
PMC6636917	A00001	al. describe the integration of directed non-targeted mass spectrometry and computational chemical networking to discover hundreds of previously unrecognized inflammatory oxylipins metabolites in human plasma, providing a foundation for new insight into the role of oxylipins in human biology.
PMC6636917	D00000	In this report, we describe approaches for the assay and identification of oxylipins in human plasma using directed, non-targeted LC-MS coupled to computational chemical networking.
PMC6636917	D00001	While traditional targeted methods for studying these compounds can produce very sensitive and quantitative measurements, directed, non-targeted analysis greatly expands upon the spectrum of species measurable in complex organisms, enables discovery of hundreds of unknown oxylipins in humans, and provide a foundation for new insight into the role of bioactive lipids in mediating human health and disease.
PMC6636917	D00002	This approach makes use of directed extraction whereby samples were prepared using methods designed specifically for isolation of oxylipins (versus a general Bligh-Dyer lipid extraction), chromatographic separation designed to separate the extensive array of isomers, non-targeted mass spectrometric measured allowing capture of all possible species, and MS/MS chemical networking allowing for identification of previously unreported compounds.
PMC6636917	D00003	Application of these approaches to human plasma revealed hundreds of putative compounds, advancing upon the current state of the art analytical techniques and greatly expanding the current chemical repertoire, revealing 134 definitively known, 362 putative known, and 46 putative novel oxylipins observable in human plasma.
PMC6636917	D00004	These molecules were validated by a number of methodologies, including extensive chemical networking of mass spectral fragmentation patterns and manual annotation of a subset of putative oxylipins.
PMC6636917	D00008	Additionally, as many other chemical compound classes exhibit similar unique chemical patterning as observed in oxylipins, such as PUFAs, endocannabinoids, FAHFAs and sterols, this approach may be adapted to perform similar discovery based work in these other chemical families, thereby potentially expanding their number of measurable entities.
PMC6636917	D00009	While greatly expanding upon the number of compounds reported in human plasma, the current experimental and computational approaches will continue to shed even more insight into oxylipin biology as they are applied in complementary systems.
PMC6636917	D00010	While the current study focuses on human plasma, undoubtedly additional oxylipins will be found localized to particular cells or tissues, or induced under particular biological conditions.
PMC6636917	D00011	Moreover, it is important to note that since our approach relies on comparing tandem MS fragmentation patterns to those of known oxylipins, our approach excludes putative compounds with completely unique fragmentation patterns and it is therefore likely that a number of additional oxylipins await discovery.
PMC6636917	D00012	Similarly, while human studies across 1500 individuals focused upon those metabolites that were initially observed in pooled human plasma, a number of additional potential oxylipins were also observed in specific individuals and are currently being investigated.
PMC6636917	D00014	Importantly, oxylipins are susceptible to non-enzymatic processing, including oxidation, and are therefore sensitive to specific collection, storage, processing and analysis methodologies (; ; ).
PMC6636917	D00017	Notably, comparison of previously collected and frozen plasma samples with fresh plasma preparations revealed that 76% of observed putative oxylipins in frozen samples were also observed in fresh samples, suggesting that assayed oxylipin metabolites were not due non-enzymatic oxidation during years of storage (data not shown).
PMC6636917	D00018	Furthermore, addition of antioxidants minimally influenced the presence or levels of oxylipins.
PMC6636917	D00020	While these data collectively suggest that artefactual, non-enzymatic modification of oxylipins during sample collection, storage, processing and analysis does not likely contribute significantly to the species observed herein, such processes cannot be ruled out completely and must be considered with follow-up biological experiments.
PMC6636917	D00021	As commercial standards are only available for a fraction of unique theoretical oxylipins, targeted studies detailing the role of these molecules in inflammation have largely been confined to this subset of metabolites, despite potentially hundreds more species present in human circulation.
PMC6636917	D00023	Furthermore, as a number of these putative metabolites were found to be highly associated with clinical characteristics and markers of inflammation, future studies will aim to further characterize these oxylipins including identifying the biochemical pathways responsible for their production and degradation, localizing individual species to specific tissues of origin, establishing causal pro- and anti-inflammatory molecules, and elucidating their downstream signaling mechanisms.
PMC6636917	D00024	Importantly, the studies described herein highlight the discovery potential of directed, non-targeted LC-MS and corresponding computational chemical networking approaches, underscore the breath, complexity and diversity of oxylipins present in humans, and provide a foundation for new insight into the role of bioactive lipids in mediating human health and disease.
PMC6636917	D01001	Key among these signaling molecules are eicosanoids and related oxylipin metabolites that derive from polyunsaturated fatty acids and mediate a number of diverse homeostatic functions in humans including systemic inflammation, cellular development, ion transport, muscle contraction, vascular tone, and thrombosis, among many others.
PMC6636917	D01002	Despite more than 1000 oxylipins predicted to exist, only a small fraction have been monitored in complex organisms to date, owing to technical limitations with targeted measurement strategies.
PMC6636917	D01003	Herein, using a directed non-targeted mass spectrometry approach in conjunction with computational chemical networking of spectral data, we greatly expand the breadth of oxylipins observable in humans, discovering hundreds of previously undescribed oxylipin species.
PMC6636917	D01004	Moreover, we find that a number of these oxylipins are strongly associated with markers of systemic inflammation in humans or clinical characteristics linked to inflammation, including advancing age and increasing obesity.
PMC6636917	D01005	These analytical approaches greatly expand the spectrum of oxylipin metabolites monitored in humans and provide a foundation for new insight into the role of bioactive lipids in mediating health and disease.
PMC6636917	M01000	Fasting, EDTA prepared plasma specimens collected in 2005-2008 from N=1500 participants (mean age 66.2±9.0 years, 55% women) of the community-based Framingham Heart Study Offspring Cohort, were used for analyses of oxylipins in human inflammation.
PMC6636917	M02001	LCMS grade solvents used for sample preparation and metabolomic analysis including methanol, acetonitrile, water, and isopropanol were purchased from Honeywell International Inc while LCMS grade ethanol and acetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
PMC6636917	M02016	Cold (−20°C) ethanol containing 20 deuterated oxylipin internal standards was used to precipitate proteins and non-polar lipids as well as extract bioactive lipids from the plasma through the addition of 1:4 plasma:ethanol-standard mixture to each well, shaking at 500rpm at 4 °C for 15 minutes, and centrifugation at 4200 rpm at 4 °C for 10 minutes.
PMC6636917	M02018	A second extraction of the protein pellet was performed by gently adding 65μL of −20 °C ethanol (containing no standards), gently hand vortex mixing for 30 seconds, and transferring another 65μL aliquot of supernatant to the same Axygen V-bottom 96-well plate, at which point samples are ready for SPE plate loading.
PMC6636917	M02019	The Phenomenex Strata-X polymeric 10mg/mL 96-well SPE plate was washed by sequentially adding and vacuum assisted eluting 600 μL of methanol and 600μL of ethanol and equilibrated by addition of 1.2mL of water per well.
PMC6636917	M02022	Once the sample volume reached the top of the SPE bed, 600μL of 90:10 water:methanol was added to each well and slowly pulled through (5 mmHg vacuum) until no liquid was visualized in the wells.
PMC6636917	M02024	Bound metabolites were then eluted into an Axygen 500μL V-bottom 96-well plate by addition of 450μL of ethanol to each SPE plate well, with slow pull through (5 mmHg vacuum) after 120 second equilibration.

PMC6636917	R00000	Comprehensive detection of oxylipins in a complex milieu, particularly for those chemical species for which no commercial standards or reference data exist, requires distinguishing chemical features.
PMC6636917	R00001	We therefore first sought to pinpoint common chemical characteristics unique to oxylipins.
PMC6636917	R00002	Review of the LIPID MAPS chemical database (www.lipidmaps.org, March 2017 version), which contains over 40,000 entries, revealed 1125 theoretically and experimentally curated, structurally distinct molecules classified as oxylipins.
PMC6636917	R00004	Given the combinatorial nature of oxylipin biosynthesis wherein only a handful of PUFAs are extensively modified through both enzymatic and non-enzymatic biosynthetic mechanisms (; ), these compounds were found to exhibit extensive isomerism with the 1125 theoretical compounds being derived from only 168 unique chemical formulas, and 786 of the 1125 compounds stemming from only 23 unique chemical formulas.
PMC6636917	R00006	Of the 168 formulas, only 9 chemical formulas (~5%) returned additional matches to non-oxylipin compounds, with the majority of these mapping to sterol, bile acid and free fatty acid metabolites, thereby suggesting that oxylipins exhibit fairly specific and unique mass characteristics.
PMC6636917	R00008	(B) Extracted ion chromatograms for all 225 oxylipin chemical standards.
PMC6636917	R00010	(D) Extracted ion chromatograms for all 134 spectral peaks observed in pooled plasma that were matched to commercial oxylipin standards.
PMC6636917	R00012	To determine whether oxylipins may be further experimentally distinguished particularly from isobaric, non-oxylipin species including sterol, bile acid and free fatty acid metabolites, we utilized a ‘directed, non-targeted’ LC-MS approach with offline solid phase extraction for enrichment of oxylipin species, reverse phase chromatography, and high mass accuracy mass spectrometry operating in full scan mode (see Methods).
PMC6636917	R00013	Commercial standards for 225 oxylipins, 14 bile acids, 8 sterols, 29 fatty acids, and 13 endocannabinoids (given that their in-source fragments may be isobaric with oxylipins) were injected as neat solutions.
PMC6636917	R00014	LC-MS analysis revealed that all 225 oxylipin standards eluted between 1.0 and 5.75 minutes on the LC gradient, exhibited consistent peak shapes (FWHM <0.1 minutes and tailing factor 0.8-1.2), and were chromatographically resolved from sterols (elution between 0.5 and 1.25 minutes), as well as fatty acids and endocannabinoids (elution between 6.0 to 7.0 minutes).
PMC6636917	R00016	Collectively this suggests that oxylipins may be distinguished from other known metabolites using chemical characteristics, including accurate mass features, chromatographic retention, and peak shape.
PMC6636917	R01000	In humans, oxylipins are produced locally in tissues, leak into the vasculature, and enter the systemic circulation (; ; ).
PMC6636917	R01001	To determine the full catalog of oxylipins present in circulation, commercial pooled human plasma prepared with EDTA anticoagulant and stored at −80 °C until analysis was assayed using our directed, non-targeted LC-MS method.
PMC6636917	R01002	Human plasma revealed 134 distinct spectral peaks definitively identified as known oxylipins by precise matching of retention time, accurate mass, and tandem MS fragmentation pattern to one of 225 commercially available standards, including well described members of prostaglandin, HETE, DHET, HODE and additional families.
PMC6636917	R01003	Human plasma also revealed an additional 745 spectral peaks across 56 distinct chemical formulas consistent with oxylipins based on accurate mass (<±2 ppm) matching to one of 1125 theoretical oxylipins in the LIPID MAPS database, retention time range (1.0 – 5.75 minutes), and peak shape (FWHM < 0.1 minutes and tailing factor 0.8-1.2) characteristics.
PMC6636917	R01006	Due to oxylipins occupying a unique chemical space, these isobaric species very likely represent additional compounds isomeric to oxylipins for which chemical standards are not currently available.
PMC6636917	R01007	For instance, search of the LIPID MAPS database for m/z 313.2384 revealed a possible 29 theoretical oxylipin species that potentially correspond to the 20 observed features at that mass.
PMC6636917	R01010	Tandem mass spectra were clustered against known oxylipins, with top 7 correlations shown.
PMC6636917	R01011	(C) Comparison of tandem mass spectra from m/z 313.2384 chromatographic peak at 3.27 minutes with that of 9,10-DiHOME, revealing similar chemical structures.
PMC6636917	R02000	The lack of commercial standards or reference tandem mass spectra have to date precluded identification or even chemical classification of unknown metabolites, including oxylipins.
PMC6636917	R02001	To overcome this limitation, we reasoned that chemical similarity between known and unknown molecules through comparison of tandem mass spectral fragmentation patterns may allow for putative classification of some of these unknown molecules as oxylipins.
PMC6636917	R02004	To determine the utility of chemical networking for chemical classification, tandem MS fragmentation patterns were obtained for 225 oxylipin commercial standards and 600 diverse, non-oxylipin standards.
PMC6636917	R02005	Fragmentation patterns from these standards were chemically networked against over 50,000 metabolites for which spectral fragmentation data were publicly available, which included additional publicly-deposited tandem mass spectra for the same 225 commercial oxylipin standards previously collected by other laboratories.
PMC6636917	R02006	From this analysis, experimentally derived tandem mass spectra for 205 of the 225 oxylipin standards were found to chemically network to corresponding spectra for the same compound present in the public library suggesting a sensitivity for matching of 86%.
PMC6636917	R02009	Among the 600 non-oxylipin standards, none were found to chemically network with oxylipin spectra and were instead found to be chemically similar to one of 50,000 other molecules present in the public libraries, suggesting near perfect specificity for this approach.
PMC6636917	R02010	This specificity for chemical matching is consistent with the fact that oxylipins, particularly cyclized variants, exhibit unique fragmentation mechanisms compared to other classes of compounds (; ; ; ; ; ).
PMC6636917	R02011	Importantly, this high specificity is critical in limiting false positive matches when extending the chemical networking to unknown molecules for classification as oxylipins.
PMC6636917	R02012	We first applied this chemical networking approach to m/z 313.2384 which exhibited two identifiable oxylipin peaks and 18 unknown isobaric features.
PMC6636917	R02013	When tandem mass spectra from these chromatographic features at were subjected to the chemical networking strategy, 16 of the 18 features were specifically matched to one of the 225 oxylipin standards.
PMC6636917	R02015	shows one such comparison between the tandem mass spectra for 9,10-diHOME and an unknown isobaric peak at retention time 3.13 minutes for which nearly identical fragmentation patterns are observed, indicating a very similar chemical structure.
PMC6636917	R02016	As such, matching of unknown compounds based on accurate mass and analogous fragmentation patterns to a known oxylipin may allow such molecules to be classified as putative known oxylipins.
PMC6636917	R02018	We next extended this chemical networking to all 745 spectral features identified as potential oxylipins, based on accurate mass match to LIPID MAPS database entries, but for which no chemical standard or reference spectra was available.
PMC6636917	R02020	Of the 745 unknown experimental tandem mass spectra, 362 spectra were chemically networked with at least one oxylipin standard and did not form secondary connections with any of the ~50,000 non-oxylipin compounds present in the library repository, thereby classifying these 362 metabolites as putative known oxylipins.
PMC6636917	R02021	The remaining 383 tandem mass spectra that did not chemically network with a known standard were mostly clustered with either non-oxylipin compounds (such as glucuronides, sterols, bile acids, and fatty acid ethyl esters) or clustered within themselves.
PMC6636917	R02022	The lack of similarity in tandem MS fragmentation patterns with any reference spectra thereby suggest that these 383 remaining chromatographic peaks cannot be considered as oxylipin in nature without further evidence.
PMC6636917	R02023	(A) Tandem mass spectra for the 745 chromatographic features matching to chemical formulas of known oxylipins was clustered against tandem mass spectra for the 225 commercial standards with the resulting correlations displayed as a nested molecular network.

PMC6636917	R02032	Importantly, algorithms for automated in silico fragmentation, such as CFM-ID and MetFrag, were not able to accurately predict fragments for these oxylipins, especially cyclized variants such as prostaglandins, given the unpredictable nature of their fragmentation (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ).
PMC6636917	R02033	However, these irregular fragmentation mechanisms favor a chemical networking approach as they allow for far fewer false positive matches to non-oxylipin compounds.
PMC6636917	R02035	Collectively, these analyses suggest that directed non-targeted LC-MS/MS in conjunction with chemical networking may be utilized to identify an additional 362 putative known oxylipins in human circulation, thereby greatly extending the analytical breath of current approaches.
PMC6636917	R03000	In addition to the ~500 known and putative known oxylipins found in human plasma, we sought to determine if unknown oxylipins, yet undescribed in any chemical database including LIPID MAPS, were also present in human circulation.
PMC6636917	R03001	Given their unique chemical properties, we reasoned additional systems chemistry approaches may prove useful in identification of unknown oxylipins.
PMC6636917	R03004	() For instance, among the prostaglandin family of eicosanoids, this type of plot reveals four distinct chemical series, where each series is incremented by addition of two hydrogens and the distance between each series represents the addition of a single oxygen.
PMC6636917	R03005	When extending this analysis beyond prostaglandins, distinct gaps in these formulaic patterns were readily observed.
PMC6636917	R03006	Among docosanoids starting at formula C_22 H_34 O_2 , database entries were present for every addition of oxygen up to C_22 H_34 O_6 with the lone exception of C_22 H_34 O_3 .
PMC6636917	R03007	When this formula’s calculated nominal mass of m/z 345.2435 was searched within the non-targeted LC-MS data collected from human plasma, a spectral peak at 4.72 minutes was observed and produced a tandem MS pattern that was nearly identical with that of the known docosanoid 10-HDoHE.
PMC6636917	R03008	Manual interpretation of the fragments showed that while 10-HDoHE has four double bonds between carbons 11 and 22, this potentially novel oxylipin only has three.
PMC6636917	R03009	This result indicated that the gaps in chemical series within oxylipin database entries may be utilized to identify putative novel oxylipins.
PMC6636917	R03010	(A) Mass defect versus nominal mass plot of 15 chemical formulas, which compose the prostaglandin series of eicosanoids, illustrating common chemical patterns within compound families.
PMC6636917	R03013	(C) Tandem mass spectra from one of these missing entries (C_22 H_34 O_3 ) was found to be highly similar to the tandem mass spectra for 10-HDoHE with both sharing common fragments (blue arrows) as well as analogous fragments that were shifted by the mass of two hydrogens (orange arrows).
PMC6636917	R03014	Manual annotation indicates that the potentially novel oxylipin is identical to 10-HDoHE with the exception that it contains 3 instead of 4 double bonds between carbons 11 and 22.
PMC6636917	R03016	To determine if additional unknown oxylipins were present in human plasma, all 1125 theoretical compounds listed in the LIPID MAPS database were plotted as nominal mass versus their mass defect and computationally analyzed for missing values along H_n+2 and O_n+1 series.
PMC6636917	R03017	This analysis was extended to include one entry preceding the lowest formula value in the series as well as one entry past the final value as long as the number of oxygens was constrained between 3 and 8 and the number of hydrogens was between 24 and 40, which represents the maximum and minimum values observed for known oxylipins of 18 to 22 carbons.
PMC6636917	R03018	This analysis revealed 214 missing unique formulas spread across almost all compound subfamilies with each one representing a potential unknown oxylipin.
PMC6636917	R03019	When the non-targeted LC-MS data from human plasma was searched for compounds matching the accurate masses for these 214 missing chemical formulas, 184 distinct chromatographic peaks present at 45 of the 214 chemical formulas were found with each of these peaks having accurate mass (< ±2 ppm) matching to a theoretical formula, a retention time range (1.0 – 5.75 minutes), and a peak shape (FWHM < 0.1 minutes and tailing factor 0.8 – 1.2) consistent with known oxylipins.
PMC6636917	R03021	The resulting analysis revealed that 46 of the 184 putative compounds clustered with at least one known oxylipin standard and none of the 50,000 non-oxylipin metabolites, indicating structural similarity is present between these putative compounds with known members of oxylipin families.
PMC6636917	R03023	One such example is an unknown compound m/z 347.2600, which corresponds to the chemical formula C_22 H_36 O_3 , and was spectrally matched as an analog to the octadecanoid 13-HoTrE. Comparison of the tandem MS fragmentation patterns between the unknown and known compounds revealed that all carboxyl-containing fragments from carbons C7 to C1 were identical between the two compounds while carboxyl-containing fragments from carbons C12/C13 to C1 were shifted by 54.0472 daltons.
PMC6636917	R03025	This systems chemistry approach thereby enables discovery of potentially novel oxylipins, identifying an additional 46 putative compounds in human circulation.
PMC6636917	R03026	Oxylipins may potentially undergo non-enzymatic oxidation during sample isolation and storage, as well as during metabolite extraction and analysis (; ; ; ).
PMC6636917	R03027	To ensure that observed known and putative oxylipins were not the result of non-enzymatic oxidation, fresh human plasma was collected in EDTA tubes with great care to avoid cell lysis, processed for plasma isolation within minutes, immediately flash frozen, and analyzed for oxylipins within twenty-four hours of collection.
PMC6636917	R03028	Additionally, samples were prepared both with and without the addition of the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) throughout the sample preparation process (see Methods).
PMC6636917	R03029	Resulting data showed 313 known and putative oxylipins were observed in the fresh plasma sample with minimal change in signal presence and stability due to the addition of BHT during the sample preparation process.
PMC6636917	R03030	Only four oxylipins were observed solely in the non-BHT sample and eight were observed solely in the BHT treated sample, with the median percent change between BHT and non-BHT treated samples of 4.6%.
PMC6636917	R03032	Collectively, this data suggests that non-enzymatic oxidation during sample collection, preparation, or analysis is unlikely contributing significantly to plasma oxylipin formation.
PMC6636917	R04000	Oxylipin lipid mediators play critical roles in regulating systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in the setting of both acute infection and chronic inflammation (; ; ).
PMC6636917	R04001	To date, however, biological functions have only been described for a fraction of the ~150 commonly studied oxylipins found in human plasma.
PMC6636917	R04002	To determine whether the hundreds of proposed putative known and putative novel oxylipins observed herein may have a role in inflammation, plasma samples previously collected from 1500 fasting, community-dwelling individuals were assayed using our directed, non-targeted LC-MS approaches.
PMC6636917	R04003	Definitive known, putative known, and putative novel oxylipins were mapped to plasma samples by matching of retention time, accurate mass, and tandem MS fragmentation patterns, with inclusion of metabolites previously observed in pooled plasma and present at above signal-to-noise thresholds in >95% of individuals.
PMC6636917	R04004	Multiple hypothesis correction was performed using standard false discovery rate (FDR), and oxylipins were statistically associated with common clinical features linked to systemic inflammation, including advancing age, obesity (measured by body mass index [BMI]), and circulating high sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a well-established marker of systemic inflammation (; ).
PMC6636917	R04005	For both clinical features and CRP measures, dozens of both known and putative oxylipins were found to be highly related, at ‘metabolome-wide’ significance thresholds.
PMC6636917	R04007	For each clinical phenotype, both positive and negative associations were observed, suggesting both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities, consistent with the described function of oxylipins.
PMC6636917	R04008	For instance, production of arachidonic acid metabolites (e.g. HETE’s and HpETE’s) showed positive correlation with BMI and CRP levels, suggesting a pro-inflammatory role for these molecules, while DiHDPA and DiHETrE metabolites showed negative correlations, suggesting an anti-inflammatory role; similar patterns have been observed in cellular systems upon acute activation of inflammatory pathways.
PMC6636917	R04012	Associations of known (blue), putative known (red), and putative novel (green) circulating plasma oxylipins with age, body mass index (BMI), and C-reactive protein (CRP) across 1500 individuals.
PMC6668592	A00003	Regarding nucleotide metabolomic intermediates, the colorectal cancer tissue contained lower levels of ribulose 5-phosphate and higher levels of xanthine, adenine, and hypoxanthine than the normal tissue.
PMC6668592	A00005	The level of tryptophan was decreased, and the levels of molecules downstream of the tryptophan pathway, such as kynurenine and quinolinic acid, which protect colorectal cancer against the host’s immune system and function in de novo nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthesis, were increased in the colorectal cancer tissue.
PMC6668592	A00006	The colorectal cancer tissue samples also contained higher levels of lysophospholipids and fatty acids, especially stearic acid and polyunsaturated fatty acids, including arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid.
PMC6668592	D00002	Our data showed that the levels of metabolites related to antioxidative activity or alternative nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) production pathways, for example, taurine and quinolinic acid (QA), were increased in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	D00003	As for metabolites related to purine metabolism, the level of ribose 5-phosphate was significantly lower in the CRC tissue samples, and the levels of adenine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine were higher in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	D00004	Concerning the metabolites related to pyrimidine metabolism, significantly higher levels of uridine monophosphate, uracil, and thymine were found in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	D00005	In contrast, the final product of nucleotide metabolism, uric acid, exhibited lower levels in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	D00006	Adenosine monophosphate can be converted into adenosine and inosine, which are then broken down into hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uric acid by xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR).
PMC6668592	D00007	XOR catalyzes the last two steps of purine catabolism, which utilizes O_2 and NAD_+ .
PMC6668592	D00008	Michael D. Williams and Xing Zhang showed that the level of hypoxanthine was elevated in normal cells under hypoxic conditions and suggested that elevated levels of hypoxanthine in CRC cells are consistent with increases in oxidative stress.
PMC6668592	D00009	Therefore, the higher level of hypoxanthine in the CRC tissue samples might suggest that CRC is subjected to oxidative stress.
PMC6668592	D00011	Consistent with our previous findings, in which CRC patients were subjected to serum metabolome analysis, the CRC tissue samples displayed the significantly lower level of tryptophan and higher levels of downstream metabolites of tryptophan, such as kynurenine, QA, cystathionine, cysteine, hypotaurine, and taurine, which are antioxidants.
PMC6668592	D00012	Tryptophan, which is an essential amino acid, is critical for cell proliferation.
PMC6668592	D00013	It plays a central role in creating an immunosuppressive environment and is metabolized through the TK pathway[].
PMC6668592	D00014	Thus, detection of tryptophan depletion and kynurenine accumulation were important findings of the present study.
PMC6668592	D00015	T lymphocytes (T-cells) are extremely sensitive to tryptophan shortages.
PMC6668592	D00016	Tryptophan depletion is related to T-cell anergy and apoptosis, whereas kynurenine suppresses T-cell differentiation and function.
PMC6668592	D00017	Thus, tryptophan depletion and kynurenine accumulation cooperate to mediate immunosuppression in tumors.
PMC6668592	D00018	The accumulation of tryptophan catabolites, such as kynurenine and QA, can result in the generation of niacin and nicotinamide as alternative substrates for NAD synthesis in a step involving quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) and nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase.
PMC6668592	D00019	The TK pathway has been established as a de novo pathway for NAD+ synthesis in the liver and kidneys.
PMC6668592	D00020	As such, cancer cells rapidly consume NAD, which means that they need more energy and require alternative NAD synthesis pathways to the pathway involving nicotinamide[].
PMC6668592	D00023	In our study, the levels of kynurenine and QA were increased in the CRC tissue samples, but the levels of nicotinic acid and NAD did not differ significantly between the CRC and normal tissue samples.
PMC6668592	D00024	These results indicate that in the CRC tissue samples, large amounts of tryptophan were metabolized to QA to produce NAD, but NAD was consumed aggressively.
PMC6668592	D00025	QA, which is a precursor to NAD, was identified as an important factor in conferring resistance to oxidative stress on gliomas.
PMC6668592	D00026	It was reported that glioma cells that expressed high levels of QPRT resisted chemotherapy-induced apoptosis by inducing NAD synthesis.
PMC6668592	D00027	CRC cells also express QPRT; therefore, the same process is expected to occur in CRC, and NAD synthesis through QA might increase the resistance of CRC to oxidative stress.
PMC6668592	D00029	Cysteine, which is the rate-limiting amino acid for glutathione synthesis and is the major cellular antioxidant in mammals, is converted into hypotaurine, which is subsequently oxidized to taurine, sulfate, and hydrogen sulfide (H_2 S)
PMC6668592	D00031	H_2 S serves to maintain the cellular bioenergetics of CRC, and promotes angiogenesis and vasorelaxation, which provides such tumors with blood and nutrients.
PMC6668592	D00032	H_2 S might also activate anti-inflammatory and antioxidant pathways and have protective effects against oxidative stress.
PMC6668592	D00033	In the current study, the higher levels of cystathionine, cysteine, hypotaurine, and taurine detected in the CRC tissue samples might indicate that a beneficial microenvironment (for CRC), involving vasodilation and angiogenesis, was induced in the CRC via H_2 S and that antioxidant activity was induced via SAA[].
PMC6668592	D00034	In addition to glutathione and cysteine, taurine plays an important role in antioxidant activity in the body, especially in the intestines, which are constantly exposed to endogenous and exogenous diet-derived oxidants.
PMC6668592	D00035	Taurine is related to bile acid conjugation and also aids lipid absorption.
PMC6668592	D00037	Combining these findings with our results, increased levels of taurine might aid lipid absorption and protect CRC cells from oxidative stress.
PMC6668592	D00038	We also observed 2.5 and 1.49 times higher levels of ascorbic acid and pantothenate, respectively, in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	D00039	Ascorbic acid, which is an antioxidant, protects cells against oxidative stress induced by ROS, so increased levels of ascorbic acid might have antioxidant effects in CRC tissue.
PMC6668592	D00040	Pantothenate contributes to the synthesis of coenzyme A, which is involved in FA synthesis.
PMC6668592	D00041	In our LC/MS analysis, most of the FA exhibited higher levels in the CRC tissue samples, so increased levels of pantothenate might stimulate de novo FA synthesis via coenzyme A.
PMC6668592	D00042	Additionally, for example, PC are also the main source of FA.
PMC6668592	D00043	Phospholipase A_2 cleaves FA from the SN_2 position of phospholipids, leading to the increased levels of lyso-phospholipids and the functions as precursors for various types of eicosanoids.
PMC6668592	D00044	In our data, lower levels of PC36:4, PE36:4p, and PC36:5e and in the CRC tissue samples were observed, and these results may exhibit the results of releasing FA 20:4(n-6) from PC36:4 and PE36:4p and the results of releasing FA20:5(n-3) from PC36:5e.
PMC6668592	D00045	Our LC/MS data also indicated that the levels of AA and EPA were increased in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	D00046	In addition, the EPA/AA ratio was significantly lower in the CRC tissue samples compared with the normal tissues.
PMC6668592	D00047	EPA antagonistically works to AA, so AA may have more effective activities in the CRC tissue compared with the normal tissue.
PMC6668592	D00048	AA is an important polyunsaturated FA for cell signaling, and it is also a precursor of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2).
PMC6668592	D00049	The level of PGE2 has been shown to be increased in human CRC tissue samples[].
PMC6668592	D00050	Tumor-derived PGE2 induces kynurenine secretion, which in turn promotes cancer cell invasion.
PMC6668592	D00051	The higher levels of AA detected in the CRC tissue samples in the present study might have been related to increased kynurenine secretion and elevated levels of TK pathway metabolites.
PMC6668592	D00052	The higher levels of antioxidant metabolites, such as cystathionine, cysteine, hypotaurine, taurine, and ascorbic acid, in CRC tissues might protect CRC from oxidative stress.
PMC6668592	D00053	The results of the present GC/MS and LC/MS-based metabolome analyses of CRC tissue samples suggest that the higher level of taurine stabilizes the cell membranes of CRC cells, and that higher levels of antioxidant metabolites, such as cystathionine, cysteine, hypotaurine, and taurine, protect CRC cells from the surrounding environment and aid the proliferation of CRC cells by regulating their redox status.
PMC6668592	M01007	In the semiquantitative analysis, the peak height of each ion was calculated and normalized to the peak height of 2-isopropylmalic acid as an internal standard.
PMC6668592	M02000	For the LC/MS-based hydrophilic metabolite analysis, 10 mg of tissue was mixed with 900 μl of a solvent mixture (MeOH:H_2 O:CHCl_3 =2.5:1:1) containing 1 μM 2-bromohypoxanthine and 1 μM 10-camphorsulfonic acid as internal standards, and then the solution was shaken at 1,400 rpm for 30 min at 37°C, before being centrifuged at 16,000 g for 3 min at 4°C.
PMC6668592	M02005	For the LC/MS-based lipid analysis, 5 mg of tissue was mixed with 80 μl of MeOH and 10 μl of 500 ppb dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (12:0/12:0; Avanti Polar Lipids, AL, USA) as an internal standard dissolved in MeOH, and then the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 min at 4°C.
PMC6668592	M02012	The lipid analysis for phosphatidylcholines (PC), phosphatidylethanolamines (PE), lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), lysophosphatidylethanolamines (LPE), and AC was mainly performed based upon the metabolites’ physicochemical properties and/or their spectral similarity with the data in public/commercial spectral libraries, because no chemical reference standards for lipids were almost available.
PMC6668592	M02013	The lipid analysis for FA, cholesterol (CHO), and bile acids was performed based upon available chemical reference standards (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc, Alabaster, AL; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis).
PMC6668592	R00007	In the LC/MS-based lipid analysis, we detected 31 FA, 7 AC, 73 PC, 56 PE, 42 LPC, 21 LPE, and 1 CHO.
PMC6668592	R00010	The levels of 5 AC were significantly increased in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	R00011	The levels of 27 and 3 PC were significantly increased and decreased in the CRC tissue samples, respectively.
PMC6668592	R00012	The levels of 15 and 6 PE were significantly increased and decreased in the CRC tissue samples, respectively.
PMC6668592	R00013	The levels of 35 LPC were significantly increased in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	R00014	The levels of 18 LPE were significantly increased in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	R00015	Interestingly, none of the LPC or LPE displayed significantly decreased levels in the CRC tissue samples (, ).
PMC6668592	R00017	The polyunsaturated PC tended to exhibit increased levels in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	R00018	The levels of polyunsaturated PE differed significantly in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	R00019	The levels of Arachidonic acid (AA) and Eicosapentaenonic acid (EPA) were increased in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	R00020	EPA is one of important polyunsaturated FA which antagonistically works to AA, so we calculated the ratio of EPA to AA.
PMC6668592	R00021	As a result, the average EPA/AA ratio was significantly lower in the CRC tissue samples (EPA/AA ratio=0.13) compared with the normal tissues (EPA/AA ratio=0.15).

PMC6668592	R00042	The changes in the levels of the metabolites involved in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutathione biosynthesis, and amino acid pathways are shown on a metabolic pathway map in .
PMC6668592	R00044	After mapping the metabolites into general biochemical pathway illustrated in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, it became clear that the levels of intermediates involved in glycolysis, the pentose pathway, glutathione biosynthesis, and the tryptophan kynurenine (TK) pathway were significantly higher in the CRC tissue samples.
PMC6668592	R00045	The levels of metabolites involved in the propanediol pathway via dihydroxyacetone phosphate were not changed.
PMC6668592	R00046	As for the levels of metabolites involved in nucleotide metabolism, the concentrations of adenine, xanthine hypoxanthine, uracil, and thymine were higher, and the level of uric acid was lower in the CRC tissue samples.

PMC6671944	A00000	The dietary lignan metabolite, enterolactone, has been suggested to have anti-cancer functions, and high serum enterolactone concentrations have been associated with decreased risk of breast and prostate cancers.
PMC6671944	A00001	We hypothesized that serum enterolactone concentrations as a marker of plant-based foods are associated with decreased risk in colorectal cancer (CRC).
PMC6671944	A00002	We measured serum enterolactone glucuronide and sulfate concentrations by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 115 CRC patients and 76 sex- and age-matched controls and analyzed the results with respect to tumor parameters, clinical parameters, and systemic inflammatory markers.
PMC6671944	A00003	Patients with colon cancer had significant lower serum enterolactone glucuronide and sulfate concentrations than controls (glucuronide: median 3.14 nM vs. 6.32 nM, P < 0.001; sulfate: median 0.13 nM vs. 0.17 nM, P = 0.002), whereas rectal cancer patients had similar enterolactone levels as controls (glucuronide: median 5.39 nM vs. 6.32 nM, P = 0.357; sulfate: median 0.19 nM vs. 0.17 nM, P = 0.452).
PMC6671944	A00004	High serum enterolactone concentrations were associated with low tumor grade, high serum creatinine levels, and concomitant diabetes.
PMC6671944	A00005	In summary, our results suggest that serum enterolactone concentrations are decreased in colon but not in rectal cancer.
PMC6671944	D00000	Dietary lignan derived enterolactone has been reported to possess anti-cancer activities and to be associated with lowered risk of prostate cancer and breast cancer.
PMC6671944	D00001	Our main finding is that colon but not rectal cancer patients have lower serum enterolactone concentrations than healthy controls.
PMC6671944	D00002	In CRC patients, low tumor grade, increased serum creatinine levels indicating impaired renal function, and concomitant diabetes were significantly associated with higher serum enterolactone concentrations.
PMC6671944	D00003	Enterolactone is metabolized from diet-derived lignans in a multistep process catalyzed by intestinal bacteria.
PMC6671944	D00004	For example, secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, which is a lignan found in high concentration in flaxseed, is converted to enterolactone in four sequential reactions catalyzed by phylogenetically and functionally distantly related anaerobic bacteria.
PMC6671944	D00005	Accordingly, high urinary excretion of enterolactone has been associated with a high diversity of the gut microbial community.
PMC6671944	D00006	In addition, low serum enterolactone levels have been associated with low fecal total bacteria and Lactobacillus-Enterococcus counts.
PMC6671944	D00007	Thus, we hypothesize that low serum enterolactone concentrations in colon cancer patients may reflect paucity of lignan-converting bacteria in these patients, or an intracolonic environment sub-optimal to bacterial metabolism and lignan conversion.
PMC6671944	D00008	Accordingly, CRC have been linked to gut microbiota dysbiosis and antibiotics are known to reduce circulating enterolactone levels.
PMC6671944	D00010	Earlier studies have reported that enterolactone exerts anti-proliferative activities on prostate and breast cancer in vivo .
PMC6671944	D00011	However, in our CRC patient cohort, serum enterolactone abundance was not associated with tumor cell proliferation, as assessed by Ki-67 immunohistochemistry (Table ).
PMC6671944	D00012	We further hypothesized that serum enterolactone could be altered by the presence of a systemic inflammatory response to the tumor.
PMC6671944	D00014	Furthermore, serum enterolactone levels were not associated with tumor stage.
PMC6671944	D00016	Given the reported anti-tumor effects of enterolactone, we hypothesized that high serum enterolactone could be associated with improved patient outcome.
PMC6671944	D00017	Our cohort had a 10-year survival follow-up but no significant associations were detected between serum enterolactone levels and patient survival.
PMC6671944	D00018	We measured serum enterolactone as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates.
PMC6671944	D00019	Consistent with earlier studies in healthy subjects we found that glucuronide conjugate was the major circulating enterolactone metabolite in both CRC patients and controls.
PMC6671944	D00020	Enterolactone, as well as other polyphenols, are readily conjugated in the intestinal wall and in the liver.
PMC6671944	D00021	Glucuronidation and sulfation are detoxification mechanisms to eliminate potentially harmful effects of enterolactone.
PMC6671944	D00022	Tumor targeted glucuronic acid cleavage from the enterolactone-glucuronide in the tumor tissue is currently under investigation as a potential adjuvant therapy in prostate cancer.
PMC6671944	D00023	We found that CRC patients with diabetes had increased serum enterolactone levels.
PMC6671944	D00024	A previous study found elevated serum enterolactone levels in patients with diabetic nephropathy and a strong correlation between serum enterolactone and creatinine levels.
PMC6671944	D00025	Accordingly, our results support the positive correlation between serum enterolactone glucuronide and creatine, suggesting that decreased urinary secretion of enterolactone may contribute to the increased serum enterolactone levels in a subset of CRC patients.
PMC6671944	D00026	Earlier reported determinants of serum enterolactone concentrations include consumption of lignan-containing foods, constipation, smoking and BMI.
PMC6671944	D00028	Increased dietary intake of lignans or fortification of food with the plant lignans have resulted in increased serum enterolactone levels.
PMC6671944	D00031	Nevertheless, we did not detect statistically significant association between serum enterolactone levels and the BMI of CRC patients.
PMC6671944	D00034	Due to cross-sectional study design, we were not able to assess, whether enterolactone reduced the risk for colon cancer and/or affected colon cancer progression at early stages.
PMC6671944	D00035	Therefore, additional studies are required to further clarify the significance of the decreased serum enterolactone levels in colon cancer patients.
PMC6671944	D00036	In conclusion, we found significantly decreased levels of enterolactone in colon cancer, but not in rectal cancer patients.
PMC6671944	D00038	Serum enterolactone levels were not significantly associated with patient gender or age, tumor stage, systemic inflammatory markers, and survival.
PMC6671944	M02005	Serum creatinine levels were analyzed with nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics platform, equipped with Bruker AVANCE III 500 MHz and Bruker AVANCE III 600 MHz spectrometers (Bruker, Billerica, MA, USA).
PMC6671944	M03000	Serum enterolactone concentrations were quantified using a novel high-throughput liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS)/MS method by measuring the free enterolactone or intact form of either glucuronide or sulphate conjugated enterolactone, as previously described.
PMC6671944	M03003	Intrabatch accuracy, precision and recovery of enterolactone were tested at low, medium and high concentrations and the relative standard deviation did not exceed 15%.
PMC6671944	M03004	Briefly, standard curves and test serum sample were prepared using standards of (±)-enterolactone-mono-β-D-glucuronide and (±)-enterolactone monosulfate ammonium salt from ReseaChem (Burgdorf, Switzerland) and enterolactone from Plantech (Berkshire, UK).
PMC6671944	M03005	Serum samples were cleaned in solid phase extraction (SPE) hydrophilic/lipophilic balanced (HBL) 96-well plates from Waters (Torrance, CA, USA) and eluted with 50/40/10% acetonitrile (ANC)/methanol (MeOH)/H_2 O and internal standard (Glycine-1 13C) was added to the eluate.
PMC6671944	M04003	Statistical significances of the differences in serum enterolactone levels between the different study groups and categorical variables were analyzed by Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test.
PMC6671944	M04004	ROC analysis was used to evaluate the capacity of the serum enterolactone level to discriminate survivors from non-survivors.
PMC6671944	R00000	Enterolactone glucuronide was the main circulating form in both CRC patients (96% of all enterolactone) and their age- and gender-matched controls (95% of all enterolactone), while sulfated enterolactone was the minor conjugation form (Table ).
PMC6671944	R00001	The patients had significantly lower serum enterolactone glucuronide levels compared to controls (median 3.41 nM vs. 6.31 nM, respectively; P = 0.001) and showed a tendency toward lower enterolactone sulfate levels relative to controls (median 3.41 nM vs. 6.31 nM,
PMC6671944	R00003	A strong correlation existed between enterolactone glucuronide and sulfate concentrations both in CRC patients (r = 0.877, P < 0.001) and in control subjects (r = 0.796, P < 0.001).
PMC6671944	R01000	Next, we analyzed the relationships between serum enterolactone concentrations and tumor and patient characteristics (Table ).
PMC6671944	R01001	Low serum abundance of both the glucuronide and sulfate conjugated forms were associated with tumor localization, namely colon compared to the rectum (P = 0.049 and P = 0.012, respectively).
PMC6671944	R01002	Indeed, patients with rectal cancer (n = 38) had similar enterolactone concentrations to controls (glucuronide: median 5.39 nM vs. 6.32 nM, P = 0.357; sulfate: median 0.19 nM vs. 0.17 nM, P = 0.452, Table ), whereas the patients with colon cancer (n = 77) had significantly lower concentrations of both enterolactone forms compared with control subjects (glucuronide: median 2.61 nM vs. 6.32 nM, P < 0.001; sulfate: median 0.13 nM vs. 0.17 nM, P = 0.002, Table ).
PMC6671944	R01003	In addition, tumor differentiation was associated with serum enterolactone levels: the CRC patients with low-grade tumors had higher enterolactone levels than the patients with poorly differentiated tumors (glucuronide: P = 0.032, sulfate: P = 0.011, Table ).
PMC6671944	R01004	Serum enterolactone levels were not associated with patient age, gender, or body mass index (BMI), tumor stage, tumor necrosis, or the the fraction of tumor cells positive for proliferation marker Ki-67
PMC6671944	R01006	Serum enterolactone glucuronide and enterolactone sulfate levels in relation to clinical and pathological characteristics of tumors.

PMC6671944	R02000	We further assessed the effect of the concomitant diseases on serum enterolactone levels in CRC patients (Table ).
PMC6671944	R02001	Hypertension- or cholesterol-lowering medication was not associated with altered serum enterolactone levels.
PMC6671944	R02002	Interestingly, patients with diabetes had higher enterolactone glucuronide and sulfate concentrations than the patients without diabetes (Glucuronide: P = 0.028 and sulfate: P = 0.021, Table ).
PMC6671944	R02003	Previously, increased serum enterolactone concentrations have been shown in patients with diabetic renal disease.
PMC6671944	R02004	Therefore, we assessed the relationship between serum levels of enterolactone and kidney function marker creatinine among CRC patients.
PMC6671944	R02005	We found a significant positive correlation between enterolactone glucuronide and creatinine (r = 0.200,
PMC6671944	R02006	P = 0.042, Table ) and a tendency towards positive correlation between enterolactone sulfate and creatinine (r = 0.177, P = 0.077, Table ).
PMC6671944	R03001	Therefore, we assessed, whether serum enterolactone levels were associated with systemic inflammatory markers.
PMC6671944	R03003	However, we did not find any statistically significant associations between serum enterolactone and these inflammatory markers (Table ; some data not shown).
PMC6671944	R04001	The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that serum enterolactone levels did not significantly discriminate survivors from non-survivors (glucuronide: cancer specific survival (CSS), area under the curve: 0.552, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.443–0.661; sulfate: CSS, area under the curve: 0.500, 95% CI: 0.390–0.610).
PMC6671944	R04002	Univariate analysis utilizing medians as cut-off points showed that serum enterolactone levels had no statistically significant association with CSS (glucuronide: hazard ratio (HR): 1.83,
PMC6671944	R04003	95% CI: 0.942–3.561, P = 0.075 and sulfate: HR: 0.96, 95% CI 0.502–1.823, P = 0.892) or overall survival (glucuronide: HR: 1.71, 95% CI: 0.986–2.968, P = 0.056 and sulfate: HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.611–1.796, P = 0.865).
PMC6671944	R04004	In multivariate survival models, enterolactone glucuronide or enterolactone sulfate levels had no statistically significant association with CSS or overall survival (OS) (Table ).

PMC6680695	M00002	The exclusion criteria from the study were: diabetes, cancers and/or chronic inflammatory diseases, pregnancy, lactation, smoking, alcoholism, vitamin or antioxidant supplement intake during the month preceding the study, use of drugs such as statins, anti-diabetics or the chronic use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); allergy, food intolerance or adverse reaction following the assumption of blueberries.
PMC6680695	M03003	Supernatant was added to 70 µL of potassium phosphate buffer (1.5M KH_2 PO_4 phosphate buffer in D_2 O, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% sodium trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-_2 H_4 ] propionate (TSP) and 0.2% of sodium azide.
PMC6680695	M03010	Chemical shifts were referenced internally to the singlet methyl resonance of TSP at 0.00 ppm.
PMC6680695	M03014	Regions between 4.90–4.65 ppm and 6.00–5.54 ppm containing residual water and urea signals were removed.

PMC6680695	R01000	All subjects met at least three criteria for the diagnosis of MetS according to the NCEP–ATP III (2001) (waist circumference for men > 102 cm and for women > 88 cm, triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol for men < 40mg/dL and for women < 50 mg/dL, blood pressure ≥ 130/80 mm/Hg, fasting glucose ≥ 110 mg/dL).
PMC6680695	R01002	All subjects had a waist circumference higher than the cut-offs provided by ATP-III, four subjects had low HDL-cholesterol level, two subjects suffered from hypertension, three subjects had hypertriglyceridemia, and two subjects suffered from impaired fasting glycemia (IFG).
PMC6680695	R03015	These six variables were assigned, according to current literature [,] to acetoacetate/acetone (V60), succinate (V57), dimethylamine (V49), trimethylamine (V47), 3-(3’-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydropropionic acid/p -hydroxyphenyl-acetic acid (V25), and 3-(3’-hydroxyphenyl)-3-hydropropionic acid/p -hydroxyphenyl-acetic acid/histidine (V21).
PMC6680695	R03023	An extremely significant decrease of acetoacetate and acetone levels was observed in urinary samples after meals with blueberries compared to meals without blueberries.
PMC6680695	R03024	The antioxidants contained in blueberries probably slow down the ketone production and oxidation/pro-inflammatory processes.
PMC6680695	R03025	Elevated ketone body levels may be a physiological consequence of enhanced ketogenesis, eventually due to a ketogenic/fat-rich nutrition or a glucose defective absorption or an insulin deficiency.
PMC6680695	R03026	In diabetic patients, ketone body concentration is high and their detection in urine is a danger marker which suggests a poorly controlled diabetes.
PMC6680695	R03027	In particular, the increased levels of acetoacetate, acetone, acetate as well as n-butyrate, α-hydroxy-n -butyrate, and β-hydroxybutyrate, derive from β-oxidation process.
PMC6680695	R03028	The insulin intake gives rise to a lowering of the ketone bodies values; the intake of meals with blueberries goes in the same direction.
PMC6680695	R03029	Lower levels of succinate in urinary samples after the meals with blueberries (Variable 57, ) with respect to meals without blueberries were observed.
PMC6680695	R03030	Succinate is an intermediate of tricarboxylic acid cycle in the glycolysis pathways.

PMC6680695	R03033	Moreover, outside the TCA cycle, new biological roles for succinate have been demonstrated as a key signal in multiple cellular functions, including the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) stabilization, the succinate and succinate receptor 1 (SUCNR1, termed G protein coupled receptor 91) signaling during inflammation and the post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins by succinylation.
PMC6680695	R03034	The low levels of succinate found in urine samples after meals with blueberries can, therefore, suggest the effect of blueberries in the regulation of glucose metabolism and inflammatory pathways.
PMC6680695	R03035	DMA (V49) and in particular TMA (V47) levels significantly decreased after meals with blueberries.
PMC6680695	R03036	As previously reported, methylamines, important osmoregulatory compounds, are produced from choline, introduced with the diet, that give rise to DMA and TMA by specific gut microflora [,].
PMC6680695	R03037	Moreover, a change in the balance of methylamine metabolism with an increment in TMA concentrations was observed in diabetic rats.

PMC6680695	R08008	The variations observed in IL-1β mRNAs obtained after consumption of meals with or without blueberries were different in the single patients.
PMC6680695	R08010	Conversely, in patient 2 a weak increase of IL-1β mRNA two hours after a meal supplemented with blueberries was observed.
PMC6680695	R08012	Our data are reinforced by previous results showing that blueberry extract added to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia induce a significant decrease of IL-1β and TNF -α released in the culture supernatants.
PMC6680695	R08015	Moreover, polyphenols from blueberries modulated the mRNAs synthesis of IL-1beta and IL-6 in RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated by LPS, but with different kinetics.
PMC6680695	R08017	TNF -α mRNA accumulation peaks 1–2 h after stimulation of murine macrophages with LPS and maximum concentrations of cytokine are found in supernatants collected after 2–4 h of culture.
PMC6680695	R08026	Blueberry phenolic acids mixture was found to show anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation and the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) induced by LPS in RAW-Blue cells.
PMC6680695	R08031	Albeit, several publications suggested that the anthocyanins are promising dietary bioactive compounds in prevention and treatment of DMT2 [,,] and the management of MetS [,,], the results of the studies on the blueberry anti-inflammatory effects in these chronic diseases are contradictory.
PMC6680695	R08036	Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying blueberry effects, such as reduction of oxidative stress and inflammation, improvement of endothelial dysfunction, regulation of cholesterol accumulation and trafficking, along with potentially influence of gut microbiota, were discussed in a recent review showing the health benefits related to blueberries consumption.
PMC6691966	A00000	Neonicotinoid insecticides are widely used replacements for organophosphate and carbamate insecticides, but the extent of human exposure is largely unknown.
PMC6691966	A00001	On the other hand, based on urinary concentrations of DEET metabolites, human exposure to N,N-diethyl-m -toluamide (DEET) appears to be widespread.
PMC6691966	A00002	We developed a fast online solid-phase extraction high-performance liquid chromatography-isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) method to measure in 200 μL of human urine the concentrations of six neonicotinoid biomarkers (acetamiprid, N-desmethyl-acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, thiacloprid), and two DEET biomarkers (3-diethyl-carbamoyl benzoic acid, 3-ethyl-carbamoyl benzoic acid).
PMC6691966	A00006	The presented method can be used to increase our understanding of exposure to neonicotinoid insecticides and DEET, and to evaluate the potential health effects from such exposures.

PMC6691966	M00014	5-hydroxy-imidacloprid
PMC6691966	M01000	Individual urine samples for method development and validation were collected in March of 2017 in Atlanta, GA, from anonymous male and female donors with no documented exposure to DEET or neonicotinoids.
PMC6691966	M02000	Stock solutions for native acetamiprid, N-desmethyl-acetamiprid, clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiacloprid were purchased as certified solutions at 1 mg/mL in acetonitrile, except imidacloprid which was in acetone.
PMC6691966	M02001	Solutions for native DCBA, ECBA, and 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid were made from powder dissolved in acetonitrile at 1 mg/mL, except ECBA, which was prepared at 0.1 mg/mL because of its inability to solubilize at higher concentrations.
PMC6691966	M02002	Individual stock solutions were combined in various proportions to prepare 12 individual calibrator spiking solutions such that a 50-μL spike into 200 μL of deionized water resulted in concentrations ranging from 0.025 to 50.0 μg/L, except DCBA which had concentrations ranging from 0.12 to 250 μg/L. Stable isotopically labeled analogs of all target analytes, except for 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid which used a surrogate for its internal standard (ISTD), were prepared at 1 mg/mL in acetonitrile.
PMC6691966	M02004	This ISTD spiking solution also contained 4-methylumbelliferyl-β -D-glucuronide hydrate and 4-methylumbelliferone-_13 C_4 at concentrations that resulted in 1 and 0.35 mg/L urine, respectively.
PMC6691966	M02005	For each sample, we monitored the deconjugated 4-methylumbelliferone/4-methylumbelliferone-_13 C_4 peak area ratio to confirm completion of the enzymatic deconjugation reaction (ratio between 1.8 and 2 based on spiked concentrations was considered acceptable).
PMC6691966	M02006	An enzyme spiking solution was prepared weekly by gently dissolving β-glucuronidase in 0.2 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH = 6.8 ± 0.1) such that a 300-μL spike in 200 μL of urine contained 1 Fishman unit per microliter of urine.
PMC6691966	M03004	After incubation, 100 μL of 10% formic acid was added to each well.
PMC6691966	M04005	A was 5% methanol in 0.1% aqueous formic acid, and mobile phase B was 100% methanol.
PMC6691966	M04006	The analytical pump mobile phase A was 0.1% aqueous formic acid, and mobile phase B was 100% acetonitrile.
PMC6691966	R00001	The Waters Oasis® HLB performed adequately and has recently been used for the quantification of several neonicotinoid biomarkers.
PMC6691966	R00003	The target compounds eluted from the SPE column in less than 1 min with 25% acetonitrile, and effectively refocused on a ThermoScientific Hypersyl GOLD™ aQ polar encapped analytical column.
PMC6691966	R01002	Precision was < 8% for all analytes except 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid (9.2% [QCL], 10.2% [QCH]).
PMC6691966	R01003	Accuracy ranged from 91.2 to 107% at the low concentration, from 93.2 to 116% at the medium concentration, and from 94.8 to 114% at the high concentration, all within the 85 to 115% acceptable range, except for 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid at the medium concentration level.
PMC6691966	R01005	Compared to the other analytes, we attribute the lower accuracy of 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid (107, 116, and 114% at the low, medium, and high concentrations, respectively) and precision (~ 10%) to not having an exact isotopically labeled analog, which was not commercially available at the time.
PMC6691966	R01006	Therefore, we used a surrogate ISTD which had the OH functional group on the 5 position of the 6-chloro-3-pyridinyl moiety instead of the 5 position of the 1H-imidazol moiety.
PMC6691966	R01007	This surrogate ISTD eluted about 20 s earlier than the native 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, which likely further contributed to reducing its effectiveness to compensate for matrix effects and to a concomitant loss in accuracy and precision.
PMC6691966	R01008	Detection frequency, median, and concentration range for DEET and neonicotinoid biomarkers measured in 60 anonymous adult volunteers Limit of detection (LOD) in μg/L: acetamiprid and clothianidin = 0.1; N-desmethyl-acetamiprid and 5-hydroxyimidacloprid= 0.03; imidacloprid and ECBA = 0.05; DCBA = 0.06; and thiacloprid = 0.01 NA , not applicable The LODs ranged from 0.01 to 0.1
PMC6691966	R01011	Method validation data for DEET and neonicotinoid biomarkers Quadratic regressions showed no statistical significance (p > 0.05) for the squared term.
PMC6691966	R01014	The stability of the DEET and neonicotinoid biomarkers in human urine and water was assessed under several storage/ handling conditions.
PMC6691966	R01016	In deionized water, we observed degradation of 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid at 25 °C and 37 °C, and, to a lesser degree, of acetamiprid, but only at 37 °C.
PMC6691966	R01017	We estimate that native 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid and acetamiprid concentrations decreased about 9% and 6%, respectively, after 17 h at 37 °C.
PMC6691966	R01021	Second, with the exception of 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, the method used stable isotopically labeled analogs as ISTDs which theoretically behaved as their unlabeled counterparts.
PMC6691966	R01022	The response ratios for each analyte in the test samples stored for 17 h at 37 °C varied less than 2% for all analytes except for 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid, which decreased about 7%.
PMC6691966	R01023	Stability of target analytes in urine showed percent differences in measured amounts below ± 15% for all analytes at both low and high levels except one value for 5-hydroxyimidacloprid which had a percent difference of − 16% for the high pool.
PMC6691966	R01024	The larger variability for 5-hydroxyimidacloprid was likely caused by the lack of an exact stable isotopically labeled analog.
PMC6691966	R01026	The higher %RSD for 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid (10.5%) was likely the result of the unavailability of a stable isotopically labeled analog.
PMC6691966	R02000	We detected the DEET metabolites in most of the 60 commercial samples analyzed (DCBA, 95%; ECBA, 83%).
PMC6691966	R02001	Furthermore, concentrations of DCBA and ECBA strongly correlated (R _2 = 0.983).
PMC6691966	R02002	These results suggest widespread exposure to DEET in these convenience samples and are in agreement with data from the 2007–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) showing that DCBA was detected in most US residents over the 8-year timespan.
PMC6691966	R02003	Furthermore, because DCBA is a known biomarker of exposure to DEET, the strong correlation between DCBA and ECBA suggests that ECBA is also an acceptable urinary biomarker of DEET.
PMC6691966	R02004	The most commonly detected neonicotinoid biomarkers were N-desmethyl-acetamiprid (90%), 5-hydroxy-imidacloprid (42%), clothianidin (37%), and imidacloprid (30%).
PMC6691966	R02005	Acetamiprid was detected in 2% of the samples, and thiacloprid was not detected in any.
PMC6691966	R02006	These data suggest that neonicotinoid metabolites are better biomarkers than the parent compounds themselves.
PMC6708594	A00000	Fludarabine is an integral anticancer agent for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and those receiving conditioning regimens prior to allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).
PMC6708594	A00002	Fludarabine undergoes cellular uptake and activation to form the cytotoxic metabolite, fludarabine triphosphate (F-ara-ATP).
PMC6708594	A01000	We have previously developed a highly sensitive LC-MS method to quantitate intracellular F-ara-ATP concentrations in a leukemic cell line.
PMC6708594	A01001	However, quantitation of F-ara-ATP concentrations within CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-lymphocytes from pharmacokinetic blood samples obtained from patients receiving fludarabine therapy is not feasible because of the limited number of T-lymphocytes that can be isolated from each blood sample.
PMC6708594	A01002	Thus, we sought to determine F-ara-ATP accumulation after ex vivo exposure of freshly isolated human CD4_+ or CD8_+ T-lymphocytes to fludarabine.
PMC6708594	A01003	The method was optimized in T-lymphocytes obtained from healthy volunteers, and proved to be a feasible method to determine F-ara-ATP accumulation in patients undergoing HCT.
PMC6708594	A02000	Considerable variability was observed in F-ara-ATP accumulation in HCT patients (10.5- and 12.5-fold in CD4_+ and CD8_+ cells, respectively), compared to healthy volunteers (1.6- and 1.9-fold in CD4_+ and CD8_+ cells, respectively).
PMC6708594	A02001	Larger variability was also observed in gene expression of transporters and enzymes involved in F-ara-ATP accumulation in HCT patients; however, F-ara-ATP accumulation was not correlated with gene expression, which is in agreement with previous studies.
PMC6708594	A03000	The quantitation of F-ara-ATP accumulation in T-lymphocytes provides a novel tool to evaluate patient sensitivity to fludarabine.
PMC6708594	A03001	This tool can be used in future studies to evaluate whether intracellular F-ara-ATP accumulation is associated with efficacy and/or toxicity in patients receiving fludarabine.
PMC6708594	D00000	F-ara-ATP is the major cytotoxic metabolite of fludarabine; therefore, estimating F-ara-ATP exposure in CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-lymphocytes could be a more predictive measure of an individual’s response to fludarabine.
PMC6708594	D00001	Unfortunately, quantitation of F-ara-ATP in T-lymphocytes from pharmacokinetic samples obtained from patients receiving fludarabine has not been feasible to date.
PMC6708594	D00002	We have demonstrated the feasibility of measuring F-ara-ATP accumulation rate in CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-lymphocytes isolated from healthy volunteers or HCT recipients.
PMC6708594	D00003	Determining intracellular F-ara-ATP accumulation may provide a direct quantitative method to evaluate the degree of fludarabine-induced immunosuppression and subsequent clinical efficacy and toxicity.
PMC6708594	D00004	This method will also allow for estimation of an individual’s intracellular F-ara-ATP exposure by establishing a ratio between plasma fludarabine and the measured ex vivo F-ara-ATP accumulation rate.
PMC6708594	D00007	Fludarabine has also proven to be a key component of reduced-intensity HCT conditioning regimens, in which fludarabine appreciably improves engraftment rates from 80% with total body irradiation (TBI) alone to >95% with fludarabine/TBI
PMC6708594	D00018	For instance, if less F-ara-ATP accumulates in the recipient’s cells during the conditioning, fewer of their immunologically competent cells will die, leading to lower donor T-cell chimerism, which may increase the risk of graft rejection, relapse, or progression of the recipient’s underlying malignancy due to low graft-versus-tumor effect [, ].
PMC6708594	D00019	Conversely, increased F-ara-ATP accumulation might result in slower recovery of immune function and increased infections, leading to higher morbidity and mortality.
PMC6708594	D00021	With our highly sensitive method to quantitate F-ara-ATP, we were able to evaluate the degree of variability in intracellular F-ara-ATP accumulation.
PMC6708594	D00022	We observed that while both healthy volunteers and HCT patients exhibit considerable variability in the accumulation of F-ara-ATP in T-lymphocytes, the variability was much greater in HCT patients.
PMC6708594	D00024	Fludarabine has been traditionally used in the treatment of CLL.
PMC6708594	D00029	Variability in the cellular uptake and activation of fludarabine in CD4_+ and CD8_+ cells may account for this differential cellular sensitivity, but our data suggest a similar degree of F-ara-ATP accumulation between the two lymphocyte subsets.
PMC6708594	D00030	We did, however, observe significant interindividual variability in F-ara-ATP accumulation in HCT patients in both lymphocyte subsets.
PMC6708594	D00031	This large variability we observed (>10-fold), as well as the 2-fold variability in plasma AUC of fludarabine, is clearly enough to expect fludarabine responses to vary as a result of variable F-ara-ATP exposure.
PMC6708594	D00033	Therefore, a biologically plausible and consistent association has not been found between clinical responses and protein or mRNA expression of transporters and enzymes involved in F-ara-ATP formation.
PMC6708594	D00034	Our results in T-lymphocytes qualitatively support these findings because we also did not observe a relationship between mRNA expression and F-ara-ATP accumulation.
PMC6708594	D00035	We observed significant variability in the gene expression of the transporters and enzymes involved in fludarabine uptake and activation, and as with the F-ara-ATP accumulation measurements, this variability was more pronounced in HCT patients than it was in healthy volunteers.
PMC6708594	D00037	However, we did not find significant associations between the levels of intracellular F-ara-ATP and the mRNA expression level of specific genes.
PMC6708594	D00038	Therefore, gene expression does not appear to be a good indicator of F-ara-ATP accumulation in CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-lymphocytes.
PMC6708594	D00049	As these preliminary studies suggest, cells exposed to higher levels of F-ara-ATP would undergo more rapid and greater cell death.
PMC6708594	D00050	Therefore, we would expect that the greater than 10-fold differences seen in intracellular accumulation of F-ara-ATP in individual HCT patients would result in differences in the degree and rate of apoptosis seen in their CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-cells.
PMC6708594	D00052	However, since there was variability in the percentage of viable cells in the T-lymphocytes not treated with fludarabine, this variability may contribute to the ability of these lymphocytes to form F-ara-ATP since fludarabine uptake and its enzymatic conversion to F-ara-ATP are active processes.
PMC6708594	D00053	The ideal experiment of correlating F-ara-ATP accumulation with the percentage of viable T-lymphocytes at each concentration and time point is not feasible because of the high number of T-lymphocytes that would be required from each donor.
PMC6708594	D00054	Future studies are needed to directly evaluate the association with F-ara-ATP accumulation and cellular apoptosis in HCT patients.
PMC6708594	D00055	An improved understanding of the pharmacodynamics of fludarabine in patients receiving fludarabine/TBI will also be gained by future studies directed to determine the association between F-ara-ATP accumulation and circulating CD4_+ and CD8_+ cells and T-cell donor chimerism.
PMC6708594	D00056	In conclusion, we have shown that adequate number of T-lymphocytes can be isolated from healthy volunteers and from patients awaiting HCT to quantitate F-ara-ATP accumulation using our novel, highly sensitive method originally developed in cell lines.
PMC6708594	D00057	We are the first to demonstrate considerable interindividual variability in intracellular F-ara-ATP accumulation rates within CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-lymphocytes.
PMC6708594	D00058	Healthy volunteers exhibited a small range of accumulation values; however, the variability in F-ara-ATP accumulation was significantly greater in patients awaiting HCT.
PMC6708594	D00059	Subsequent translational studies will be necessary to evaluate whether F-ara-ATP accumulation or estimated exposure provides a novel diagnostic tool to predict an individual’s sensitivity and response to fludarabine, with the long-range goal of individualizing fludarabine doses to improve the efficacy and/or toxicity of this important nucleoside analog.
PMC6708594	M00008	A mononuclear-enriched apheresis product was obtained from the healthy volunteers to optimize the methods to enrich and evaluate CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-cells for intracellular F-ara-ATP accumulation.
PMC6708594	M01000	The measurement of F-ara-ATP accumulation was initiated in each cell population independently within 2 hours of cell isolation.
PMC6708594	M01001	Cells were incubated in fludarabine (5 μM) in RPMI 1640 media (not containing phenol red) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) antibiotic/antimycotic for 4 hours at 37°C in the presence of 5% CO_2 .
PMC6708594	M01004	A minimum number of 1.25×10_5 cells were needed per incubation to form adequate amounts of F-ara-ATP for accurate quantitation.
PMC6708594	M01006	After fludarabine exposure, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, centrifuged, and solubilized in 1 M perchloric acid.
PMC6708594	M01007	Samples were frozen at −70°C prior to F-ara-ATP quantitation.
PMC6708594	M02001	F-ara-ATP was quantitated using the LC-MS method described previously, with the following modifications.
PMC6708594	M02003	The mobile phase consisted of 20 mM ammonium formate pH 8 (A) and methanol (B) with the following gradient: initial 96.5% A and 3.5% B to 12% B at 5 minutes, then 3.5% B at 8 minutes.
PMC6708594	M02004	Chloroadenosine triphosphate was used as an internal standard.
PMC6708594	M02005	The F-ara-ATP quantitation assay is highly sensitive and provides a limit of detection equivalent to 50 fmol F-ara-ATP.
PMC6708594	M02006	The units for all F-ara-ATP accumulation rates were pmol/1×10_6 cells/4 hours.
PMC6708594	M03003	Gene-specific TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used to quantitate gene expression of key transporters and enzymes involved in F-ara-ATP accumulation (see ): hENT1 (Hs00191940_m1), hENT2 (Hs00155426_m1), hCNT3 (Hs00223220_m1), dCK (Hs00176127_m1), CN-II (Hs00366992_m1), and dNT-1 (Hs00274359_m1) relative to an internal endogenous control β-glucuronidase (GUS) (4333767F) on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
PMC6708594	M03011	Statistical analyses were performed to evaluate associations between gene expression and F-ara-ATP accumulation in CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-lymphocytes from HCT patients.
PMC6708594	M03014	Analysis was performed using the 3 predictors of the two main determinants of F-ara-ATP accumulation: the genes of the uptake transporters pathway (hENT1 , hENT2 , and hCNT3 ) and the genes involved in the intracellular formation of F-ara-AMP (dCK , CN-II , and dNT-1 ).
PMC6708594	M04002	At each fludarabine concentration and time point, 1.25×10_6 cells were incubated in RPMI media (not containing phenol red) at 37°C, and washed and resuspended in 1 mL PBS.
PMC6708594	R00002	F-ara-ATP accumulation was linear over a starting cell number from 1.25×10_5 to 2×10_6 cells (data not shown).
PMC6708594	R00003	Further, in both CD4_+ and CD8_+ cells, incubation with fludarabine demonstrated a linear relationship between initial fludarabine concentration and F-ara-ATP accumulation in the range of 1.25 to 10 μM (data not shown).
PMC6708594	R00004	In addition, F-ara-ATP accumulation was also linear up to an incubation time of 4 hours (data not shown).
PMC6708594	R00005	We achieved reliable assay detection of intracellular F-ara-ATP concentrations with starting cell numbers of less than 1.25×10_5 cells incubated with 5 μM fludarabine for 4 hours.
PMC6708594	R00006	The replicates within each cell type displayed low variability, as calculated by dividing the lowest F-ara-ATP accumulation by the highest value in each cell type from each healthy volunteer.
PMC6708594	R00008	The majority of the replicates (i.e. 88%) provided F-ara-ATP accumulation values that were at least within 90% of each other.
PMC6708594	R00009	Thus, we concluded that apheresis products with subsequent autoMACS™ isolation of CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-lymphocytes provided adequate cell numbers to quantitate F-ara-ATP accumulation.
PMC6708594	R00011	F-ara-ATP accumulation in healthy volunteers was 7.74 ± 1.02 and 8.66 ± 1.92 pmol/1×10_6 cells/4 hours in CD4_+ and CD8_+ cells, respectively.
PMC6708594	R00012	No correlation was observed between the F-ara-ATP accumulation in CD4_+ cells and CD8_+ cells isolated from the same individual (r_2 = 0.135).
PMC6708594	R00013	Interindividual variability in F-ara-ATP accumulation varied 1.6-fold (range: 6.0 – 9.5) in CD4_+ cells and 1.9-fold (range: 6.4 – 12.4) in CD8_+ cells isolated from healthy volunteers.
PMC6708594	R00014	Range of F-ara-ATP accumulation in CD4_+ (●) and CD8_+ (◯) T-lymphocytes isolated from healthy volunteers and patients awaiting HCT.
PMC6708594	R01000	After method optimization in the T-lymphocytes obtained from healthy volunteers, we determined the feasibility of obtaining enough CD4_+ ad CD8_+ cells from patients awaiting HCT to evaluate ex vivo F-ara-ATP accumulation.
PMC6708594	R01005	Accurate quantitation of F-ara-ATP accumulation was achieved in all of the 34 HCT patients that underwent CD4_+ and CD8_+ isolation.
PMC6708594	R01006	F-ara-ATP accumulation was assessed in two replicates per cell type.
PMC6708594	R01007	The replicates within each cell type displayed low variability, as calculated by dividing the lowest F-ara-ATP accumulation by the highest value in each cell type from each patient.
PMC6708594	R01009	The majority of the replicates (i.e. 74%) provided F-ara-ATP accumulation values that were at least within 90% of each other.
PMC6708594	R01010	While the mean values (± s.d.) of F-ara-ATP accumulation in CD4_+ and CD8_+ cells were not statistically different in HCT patients compared to healthy volunteers (10.74 ± 6.05 and 9.74 ± 4.46 pmol/1×10_6 cells/4 hours in CD4_+ and CD8_+ cells from HCT patients, respectively), the interindividual variability was significantly larger in the HCT patients.
PMC6708594	R01011	F-ara-ATP accumulation varied 10.5-fold (range: 3.5 – 36.7) in CD4_+ cells and 12.5-fold (range: 1.7 – 21.3) in CD8_+ cells.
PMC6708594	R01012	In addition, a modest association was found between F-ara-ATP accumulation in individual patient’s matched CD4_+ and CD8_+ cells.
PMC6708594	R01013	No correlation was observed between F-ara-ATP accumulation and age, gender, or disease state from CD4_+ or CD8_+ cells in these HCT patients (data not shown).
PMC6708594	R01014	Correlation between F-ara-ATP accumulation (pmol/1×10_6 cells/4 hours) in CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-lymphocytes in HCT patients (n = 34).
PMC6708594	R02000	We then evaluated the mRNA expression levels of the transporters (hENT1 , hENT2 , hCNT3 ) and enzymes (dCK , CN-II , and dNT-1 ) important in the uptake of fludarabine and subsequent formation of F-ara-ATP (see ).
PMC6708594	R02004	Similar to what we observed with F-ara-ATP accumulation in CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-lymphocytes, we saw much higher interindividual variability in gene expression in the HCT patients compared to healthy volunteers.
PMC6708594	R02007	Statistical analysis showed no association between gene expression levels for the transporters and enzymes involved in fludarabine uptake and activation and intracellular accumulation of F-ara-ATP in CD4_+ and CD8_+ lymphocytes from HCT patients.
PMC6708594	R02008	The mRNA expression of dNT-1 was associated with F-ara-ATP accumulation in CD8_+ cells (p < 0.0005), but the slope of the association was very small; therefore, it is unlikely that dNT-1 mRNA expression is a good marker for T-lymphocyte F-ara-ATP accumulation.
PMC6708594	R02009	Variability in mRNA expression of the transporters and enzymes involved in F-ara-ATP accumulation in CD4_+ and CD8_+ T-lymphocytes
PMC6708594	R03001	One hypothesis would be that an increased rate of accumulation of the active metabolite F-ara-ATP in T-lymphocytes would presumably lead to more rapid and/or a greater degree of cell death.
PMC6708594	R03006	No apoptosis was observed after a 4 hour incubation with 5 μM fludarabine which were the conditions used to evaluate intracellular F-ara-ATP accumulation (described in the methods), which indicates that little cell death is occurring during our incubation time for F-ara-ATP quantitation.
PMC6718375	A00008	The potential of using FAIMS to select ions for in-source collision-induced dissociation is demonstrated for FAIMS-selected methylxanthine ions yielding characteristic fragment ion species indicative of the precursor.
PMC6718375	M01000	Acetonitrile and water LC-MS grade ammonium acetate HPLC grade were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK).
PMC6718375	M01001	L-Carnitine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA), and hydrocortisone was purchased from Acros Organics (New Jersey, USA).
PMC6718375	M01003	A standard solution of L-carnitine and hydrocortisone (0.005 mg mL_−1 ) was prepared in a mixture of acetonitrile:water (95:5, v /v ).
PMC6718375	M02001	In order to precipitate proteins, ice-cold acetonitrile was added to a urine aliquot (3:1 v /v ).
PMC6718375	M03004	For chromatographic separation, mobile phase A (10 mM ammonium acetate in water) and mobile phase B (10 mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile:water (98:2 v /v )) were used.
PMC6718375	M04011	All masses were internally recalibrated in Agilent Mass Hunter Software by using the L-carnitine standard.
PMC6718375	R00002	The less polar compound, hydrocortisone, was eluted at the very beginning of the chromatography run (0.802 min) while the quaternary ammonium compound L-carnitine was strongly retained on HILIC column and eluted with a retention time of 8.21 min, towards the end of the 9-min chromatographic run.
PMC6718375	R00042	Its increase may be explained by the fact that N -methylguanosine is a degradation product of tRNA and can increase as the biofluid is ageing.
PMC6718375	R00049	This result can be compared with the Human Metabolome Database, in the similar way as it is done using tandem mass spectrometry analysis (MS/MS), which facilitates the ion identification as methylxanthine.
PMC6751322	A00005	Metabolites found to be most strongly correlated with change in depressive symptoms were branched chain amino acids, acylcarnitines, methionine sulfoxide, and α-aminoadipic acid (negative correlations with symptom change) as well as several lipids, particularly the phosphatidlylcholines (positive correlation).
PMC6751322	A01000	major depression, cognitive behavioral therapy, metabolomics, acylcarnitines, branched-chain amino acids, lipids
PMC6751322	D00001	Changes in several metabolite modules, containing primarily short-chain acylcarnitines and α-aminoadipic acid (purple module) as well as branched-chain and neurotransmitter-related amino acids (yellow module) and lipids (green-yellow module), were significantly associated with changes in depressive symptom severity over the 12-weeks of CBT treatment.
PMC6751322	D00004	Our analyses found specific amino acids, acylcarnitines, phosphatidylcholines, and sphingomyelins were associated with the depressed state and with changes after CBT treatment.
PMC6751322	D00005	Most notably, concentrations of the BCAAs isoleucine and valine, along with methionine sulfoxide and α-aminoadipic acid, showed strong inverse correlations with change in depression severity.
PMC6751322	D00008	We have shown that MDD patients have alterations in the phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan pathways, which are involved in the biosynthesis of the monoamine neurotransmitters (; ; ).
PMC6751322	D00011	The lipid perturbations, especially those of the phosphatidylcholines (consisting of either diacyl or alkyl-acyl moieties) showed positive correlations to the changes in HAM-D_17 scores.
PMC6751322	D00012	Phosphatidylcholines are a large class of lipid molecules commonly known as the glycerophospholipids.
PMC6751322	D00014	Phosphatidylcholines have been implicated in MDD in several studies.
PMC6751322	D00015	Recently suggested that a subclass of the phosphatidylcholines (the ether-phosphatidylcholines) might have a shared genetic etiology with MDD, and thus might be candidates for improved diagnosis and treatment of depression.
PMC6751322	D00016	Our previous work with ketamine have implicated these lipids along with acylcarnitines in the mechanism of response to ketamine.
PMC6751322	D00018	The BCAAs, their catabolic byproducts, the short chain acylcarnitines, the lysine metabolite α-aminoadipic acid, and the aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan) were present at comparatively higher levels at baseline in the treatment failures compared to the remitters.
PMC6751322	D00022	The two outcome groups also differed in their metabolomic profiles at baseline, with approximately 75% of the phosphatidylcholines being elevated in the remitters compared to the treatment failures, suggesting that levels of these lipid components may serve as moderators of outcome to CBT.
PMC6751322	D00033	Specifically, BCAAs, methionine sulfoxide, α-aminoadipic acid, and multiple phosphatidylcholines were all altered in association with changes in the HAM-D_17 scores at a level that equaled or exceeded a correlation coefficient of 0.4.
PMC6751322	M00003	Patients meeting all eligibility criteria were randomized in a 1:1:1 manner to receive either CBT (delivered in up to 16 one-hour individual sessions), escitalopram, or duloxetine for 12 weeks.
PMC6751322	M00008	The only other psychotropic agents permitted during the trial were sedatives (eszopiclone, zolpidem, zaleplon, melatonin, or diphenhydramine) up to three times per week.
PMC6751322	M01001	This procedure provides measurements of up to 186 endogenous metabolites in quantitative mode (amino acids and biogenic amines) and semi-quantitative mode (acylcarnitines, sphingomyelins, phosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylcholines across multiple classes).
PMC6751322	M02001	This procedure provides measurements of up to 186 endogenous metabolites in quantitative mode (amino acids and biogenic amines) and semi-quantitative mode (acylcarnitines, sphingomyelins, phosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylcholines across multiple classes).
PMC6751322	R02002	(R _2 > 0.3, at p < 0.1) with changes in the symptom severity scores: (a) the purple module containing the short chain acylcarnitines (C3, C4, and C0), α-aminoadipic acid, and the two amino acids, Glutamate and Proline; (b) the yellow module containing the BCAAs, Isoleucine and Valine, the BCAA-derived C5-carnitine (Isovalerylcarnitine), the neurotransmitter-related amino acids Tryptophan, Tyrosine, Phenylalanine, Methionine, Methionine-sulfoxide, and the biogenic amine Sarcosine; and (c) the green-yellow module containing 96 lipid molecules including the phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, and acylcarnitines.
PMC6751322	R02011	α-aminoadipic acid showed the strongest correlation to HAM-D_17 changes (R _2 = –0.52, p < 7E-06).
PMC6751322	R02012	The BCAA-derived C3- (propionyl) and C4- (butyryl) carnitines were strongly correlated to each other (R _2 = 0.93, p < 1.3E-11) as well as to α-aminoadipic acid.
PMC6751322	R02013	C3-carnitine was the hub metabolite in this module.
PMC6751322	R02018	All members were negatively correlated to HAM-D_17 changes, with the BCAA valine and the known oxidative stress biomarker methionine sulfoxide perturbations showing the strongest correlations with HAM-D_17 changes (R _2 < –0.40, p < 0.05).
PMC6751322	R02020	Notable were the strong positive correlations between the branched chain amino acids and methionine, sarcosine, and the neurotransmitter related amino acids (phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine) indicating that they may be functionally related.
PMC6751322	R02021	Valine was the hub metabolite for this module.
PMC6751322	R02026	Unlike the amino acids and the short chain acylcarnitines from the purple and yellow modules, these lipid molecules’ changes were positively associated with HAM-D_17 changes and also to each other (,.
PMC6751322	R02027	In univariate linear mixed model analysis, the log2 fold changes of the α-aminoadipic acid, the branched chain amino acids, isoleucine and valine, methionine-sulfoxide and several of the phosphatidylcholines, containing long chain fatty acids, from the green-yellow module, were found to be significantly associated (p < 0.10) with the changes in HAM-D_17 scores after adjusting for age and sex.
PMC6751322	R02033	In the green-yellow module, consisting of lipids, ∼75% of the phosphatidylcholines were higher at baseline in the remitters compared to the treatment failures, with some of them being statistically significant at p < 0.10 (PC aa- C30:0, C34:1, C36:2, C36:3, PC ae- C36:0, C38:2).
PMC6751322	R02034	In the purple and yellow modules, consisting mostly of amino acids including BCAAs and the short-chain acylcarnitines, the remitters mostly had lower baseline levels but showed an upward trend in their metabolite trajectories from baseline to week 12 while the treatment failures all trended to decrease to lower levels post-therapy.
PMC6780060	A00007	Specifically, both amino acids and amino acid-related analytes, as well as specific bile acids, were associated with macro-albuminuria.
PMC6780060	A00008	Additionally, specific bile acids were associated with glycemic control, anti-hypertensive medication, statin medication, and clinical lipid measurements.
PMC6780060	D00001	The optimized sample preparation procedure, including the derivatization of amino acids and related compounds, was fast, and, by optimization of the solvent composition, we could improve the sensitivity and robustness of the derivatization step in comparison with the conventional derivatization procedures.
PMC6780060	D00003	The advantage of the derivatization is that it increases the retention of the amino acids and thus allows the use of reversed-phase LC, which is more robust than, for example, hydrophilic interaction chromatography, particularly when the goal is to simultaneously analyze very polar (e.g., small amino acids) and relatively non-polar compounds (e.g., bile acids).
PMC6780060	D00016	In the general population, predictors of incident albuminuria include age, male sex, smoking, and low HDL cholesterol level.
PMC6780060	D00019	We observed alterations in many of the amino acids measured, although not all changes reached statistical significance.
PMC6780060	D00020	Our results agree with a recent study that showed altered plasma amino acid profiles in DKD, showing that tyrosine was significantly increased in T2D patients with microalbuminuria.
PMC6780060	D00021	Tyrosine has, in a recent meta-analysis, been shown to be one of the risk factors for T2D with 36% increased risk.
PMC6780060	D00022	Several studies have indicated that abnormal amino acids levels are associated with diabetic kidney disease, although with somewhat contrary patterns of amino acids [,,,].
PMC6780060	D00023	Indeed, changed amino acids metabolites might actually be more contributable to the dysregulated renal filtration state, which is unlikely to be revealed in the early pathologies of DKD, as suggested in a recent systematic review of metabolic biomarkers of DKD.
PMC6780060	D00024	We also observed associations between the eGFR and ADMA, glutamine, taurine, and citrulline, in agreement of several previous studies [,].
PMC6780060	D00025	Particularly, ADMA has been suggested as a candidate biomarker for diabetic kidney complications, whilst elevated levels of ADMA have been shown to predict a more accelerated course of renal function loss and promoted the development of renal damage [,,].
PMC6780060	D00026	Bile acids which have important roles as signaling molecules controlling glucose, lipid, and energy metabolism were significantly different in subjects with macro-albuminuria, and they were further associated with glycemic control.
PMC6780060	M00000	LC-MS grade water (H_2 O), methanol (MeOH), isopropanol (IPA), and acetonitrile (ACN) were purchased from Honeywell International Inc. (Morristown, NJ, USA).
PMC6780060	M00001	HPLC grade dichloromethane (DCM), anhydrous ACN, analytical grade formic acid (HCOOH), and reagent grade potassium carbonate (K_2 CO_3 ), potassium bicarbonate (KHCO_3 ), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl), and 5-sulphosalisylic acid dehydrate (SSA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany).
PMC6780060	M00002	6-aminoquinoline-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl carbamate (AQC) for derivatization of amino acids was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Dallas, TX, USA).
PMC6780060	M00003	Stock solutions (4.0 mg mL_−1 ) of the analytes and internal standards ( and ) were prepared by dissolving in 0.1 M HCl, H_2 O, H_2 O:MeOH (90:10, v /v ) or in MeOH and further diluting them with 0.6 M carbonate buffer (pH 8.9) and 1 M NaOH (3:1, v /v ) (in order to subsequently neutralize and adjust the pH) to the following concentration levels: 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2500, 5000, 7500, 10,000, 25,000, 50,000, and 75,000 ng mL_−1 .
PMC6780060	M00005	The samples were vortex mixed and 20 µL of a 5 mg mL_−1 AQC-reagent, which was dissolved in anhydrous ACN (at 55 °C) was added for derivatization of the amino acids and related metabolites (Supplementary Figure S4).
PMC6780060	M00008	For α(R)-OHB and α(S)-OHB, only three measuring points could be used due to the high LOD of these analytes.
PMC6780060	M02002	A total of 10 µL of 1 M 5-sulphosalisylic acid dehydrate (SSA) solution was added to 30 µL of plasma sample, samples were vortex mixed and centrifuged at 9000 RCF (5 min at 4 °C) after which 20 µL of the upper phase was collected.
PMC6780060	M02003	After, addition of 20 µL of the ISTD MIX 20 µL of a 6-aminoquinoline-N-hydroxy-succinimidyl carbamate-reagent (AQC-reagent) (5 mg mL_−1 , at 55 °C) was added, and the samples were vortex mixed and stored at −80 °C until analysis.
PMC6780060	M03002	Here two mixtures, ACN:MeOH:IPA:H_2 O (1:1:1:1, v /v /v /v ) + 0.1% HCOOH and 10% DCM in MeOH, were used for 8 s after each injection in order to clean the needle and the needle seat.
PMC6780060	M03003	Finally, the needle and the needle seat were flushed with the initial gradient conditions for 8 s. Separations were performed on a Kinetex_® F5 column (100 × 2.1 mm, particle size 1.7 µm) from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA, USA) with a flow rate of 0.4 mL min_−1 and an injection volume of 2 µL. H_2 O + 0.1% HCOOH (A) and ACN:IPA (2:1, v /v )
PMC6780060	R01000	Here, we combined a simple protein precipitation with acid followed by derivatization of amino acids and structurally-related compounds (Figure S4).
PMC6780060	R01001	For the protein precipitation, acidic conditions were chosen, as protein precipitation with methanol or acetonitrile would have required evaporation of the solvent prior to derivatization and analysis.
PMC6780060	R01004	Dry ACN was used for dissolving the AQC-reagent, as even trace amounts of water in the solvent can react with the reagent.
PMC6780060	R01005	The final sample preparation conditions included protein precipitation with SSA, followed by neutralization and pH adjustment using a mixture of carbonate buffer and NaOH) prior to the derivatization with AQC in anhydrous ACN.
PMC6780060	R01006	The MS spectra showed that only amino acids and related compounds with amino acid functionality (namely the amino acids, AADA, ADMA, SDMA, kynurenine, and taurine) were derivatized and not any of the other targeted compounds.
PMC6780060	R02005	All the derivatized amino acids and related compounds produced the product ion [M-H-170]_− .
PMC6780060	R02018	For a few of the analytes, the resolution was; however, insufficient to achieve baseline separation and due to very similar MS/MS-spectra these metabolites (Leu and Ile, TDCA and TCDCA, GCDCA, and GDCA, ADMA, and SDMA) were quantified together.
PMC6780060	R02020	The peak numbers correspond to the following analytes: (1) Crea, (2) GBB, (3) β-OHB, (4) N-MNA, (4) Kynu, (6) Leu and Ile, (7)
PMC6780060	R02021	Phe, (8) AzelA, (9) Trp, (10) TUDCA, (11) TCA, (12) GCA, (13) GUDCA, (14) TDCA and TCDCA, (15) CA, (16) CDCA, (17) GCDCA and GDCA, (18) UDCA, (19) DCA, (20) Gly, (21) Gln, (22) ADMA and SDMA, (23) taurine, (24) Phe, (25) Gln, (26) HCit, (27) Ala, (28) AADA, (29) IndS and (30) Tyr.
PMC6780060	R03005	For the analytes which were quantified together (i.e., GCDCA and GDCA, ADMA and SDMA, and TDCA and TCDCA), only one ISTD was used.
PMC6780060	R03006	The ISTDs used for GCDCA and GDCA, ADMA and SDMA, and TDCA and TCDCA were GDCA-d6, ADMA-d7, and TCDCA-d9, respectively.
PMC6780060	R03007	Additionally, for three analytes (i.e., GBB, Crea, and β-OHB), the ISTD signal was not repeatable and; therefore, the validation parameters of these analytes were measured without normalization to an ISTD.
PMC6780060	R04003	The clinical variables assessed were age, antihypertensive medication, BMI, duration of diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin day dose, sex, smoking, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and total triglycerides.
PMC6780060	R04006	The highest Pearson correlation to the albuminuria group variable among the clinical variables was 0.21 for total triglycerides.
PMC6780060	R04009	Metabolite concentrations entered the model as the dependent variable, participant identity as the random effect and the following clinical variables as fixed effects: albuminuria group, age, BMI, estimated globular filtration rate (eGFR; kidney function), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; glycemic control), sex, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, total triglycerides.
PMC6780060	R04020	Estimated globular filtration rate (eGFR; kidney function), was associated with ADMA and SDMA, Cit, Gln, taurine, and Tyr.
PMC6780060	R04021	Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c; glucose control) was associated with decreased GCDCA and GCDA, Glu, and HCit.
PMC6780060	R04023	Although no metabolomic associations were found with age or BMI in this small sub-study, several metabolites were associated with sex, statin medication, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and total triglycerides.
PMC6813219	D00008	Among these metabolites, we detected higher levels of L-methionine and homocysteine in IBS samples.
PMC6813219	D00009	Methionine and homocysteine are common amino acid obtained from food.
PMC6813219	D00010	Both methionine and homocysteine are generally considered to play an important role in intestinal health (Townsend et al., ).
PMC6813219	D00011	Homocysteine is an intermediary metabolite in methionine/cysteine metabolism.
PMC6813219	D00012	Consistent with our findings, Qian et al. reported that plasma homocysteine levels in IBS rats were significantly greater than in control rats and homocysteine-lowering treatment restored the barrier function in IBS mice (Zhao and Qian, ).
PMC6813219	D00013	These results suggested the role of homocysteine in disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier in IBS patients.
PMC6813219	D00015	For example, L-leucine was positively correlated with adipic acid (R = 0.83, P < 0.001).
PMC6813219	D00016	Adipic acid is a human xenobiotic metabolite and increased in urine of diabetes patients (Sonmez et al., ).
PMC6813219	D00017	Leucine is an essential amino acid in humans and contributes to regulation of blood-sugar levels.
PMC6813219	D00018	In addition, adipic acid and L-leucine have been identified as key factors of anti-inflammation mechanism of forsythiae fructus in rats (Yuan et al., ).
PMC6813219	D00019	Thus, those results suggested the positive associations between adipic acid and L-leucine might contribute to the inflammation process of IBS.
PMC6813219	D00023	It is reported that several strains of Lachnospira were capable of producing lactate and acetate, which caused constipation by inhibiting mucin secretion (Canani et al., ).
PMC6813219	D00035	To our interest, we found that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was included in module turquoise.
PMC6813219	D00036	It has been reported that the disruption of GABA leaded to neurological disease and enhancing GABA inhibition could alleviated sleep disorders, chronic pain and anxiety which have higher prevalence in IBS patients (Adeghate and Ponery, ; Raskov et al., ).
PMC6813219	D00037	Therefore, combined with our study, the results suggested the potential role of GABA in the treatment of visceral pain disorders.
PMC6813219	D00039	The association studies of differentially abundant microbes and metabolites showed that microbes were significantly correlated with each other, and 4 metabolites (homocysteine, putrescine, glycine, and ornithine) were strongly associated with several microbes (Clostridium, Lachnospira, Intestinibacter , and et al.).
PMC6813219	D00047	In addition, both studies showed the level of homocysteine elevated in the IBS group.
PMC6813219	M02006	The residue was further exacted with 200 μL methanol and centrifugated again under the same conditions.
PMC6813219	M02012	The reference library was developed consisting of 132 methyl and ethyl chloroformate (MCF and ECF) derivatized compounds with their mass spectral and retention index information for metabolite identification.
PMC6813219	R03002	Among these, 10 amino acid were positively correlated with 5 organic acids, such as L-isoleucine with Gamma-Aminobutyric acid.
PMC6813219	R03010	Among them, partial amino acid is positively correlated with organic acid, such as L-Isoleucine with adipic acid.
PMC6813219	R05004	The results revealed several significant metabolites–microbe relationships, including strongly positive association between glycine level and Clostridium , positive correlation of homocysteine with Lachnospira, Clostridium and Haemophilus , and negative association of homocysteine with Corynebacterium and Lachnospiraceae .
PMC6815665	A01000	This pilot study aims to identify clinical and metabolite markers that predict response to lisinopril.
PMC6815665	A02000	Hypertensive patients (n = 45) received lisinopril (10 mg) at their baseline visit.
PMC6815665	A02002	Responders to lisinopril (n = 19) were defined by a 10% decline in systolic blood pressure.
PMC6815665	A03000	BMI (p = 0.009), GFR (p = 0.015) and 2-oxoglutarate were included in a logistic regression model to predict response to lisinopril.

PMC6815665	M00000	This was a secondary analysis of a parent trial examining the pharmacogenomic effectiveness of metoprolol succinate in hypertensive patients (NCT02293096).
PMC6815665	M00005	Patients who responded to lisinopril therapy with at least a 10% decline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at their follow-up visit were defined as “responders”.
PMC6815665	M00008	The day and time of last dose of lisinopril were recorded at follow-up.
PMC6815665	M00009	All subjects reported compliance to taking lisinopril at follow-up and 70% of the cohort had follow-up BP measurements performed within one half-life of their last lisinopril dose.
PMC6815665	M01005	Non-polar metabolites were extracted from plasma in ice-cold methanol at a 1:10 dilution.
PMC6815665	M01008	Supernatants were diluted 1:1 using 10 mM ammonium and stored at − 80 °C prior to metabolomic analyses.
PMC6815665	M01009	Plasma extracts were injected into a Thermo Vanquish UHPLC system (San Jose, CA, USA) coupled to a Thermo Q Exactive mass spectrometer with electrospray ionization (Bremen, Germany).
PMC6815665	M01010	Polar metabolites were separated on a Kinetex C18 column (150 × 2.1 mm, 1.7 μm—Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) at 45 °C using a 5-min gradient method at 450 pl/min and mobile phases (A: water/0.1% formic acid; B: acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid) for positive ion mode.
PMC6815665	M03001	Significant metabolites and clinical variables were investigated together using multinomial logistic regression tests to predict response to lisinopril.
PMC6815665	R00000	Of the total participant population (n = 45), 19 subjects (42.2%) were defined as responders to lisinopril therapy at their follow-up visit [median% SBP decline (IQR): − 16.5% (− 20.4%, − 14.0%) vs. − 4.8% (− 7.0%, 2.3%) responder vs. non-responder, respectfully, p < 0.001].
PMC6815665	R00003	Responders and non-responders did not differ in the number of days on lisinopril between baseline and follow-up or the time since last lisinopril dose at follow-up.
PMC6815665	R00004	Some subjects were taking other antiHTN medications at their baseline visit (4 responders vs. 5 non-responders), however within our patient population, we found no significant correlation between lisinopril responsiveness and whether or not an individual was taking other antiHTN medications.
PMC6815665	R00005	Similarly, we did not observe any correlation between lisinopril responsiveness and whether or not subjects were taking NSAIDs or steroids.
PMC6815665	R00014	Lisinopril is not metabolized after absorption and is excreted unchanged, therefore increased renal excretion (higher GFR) is expected to be associated with decreased lisinopril availability and decreased responsiveness.
PMC6815665	R00015	Checking lisinopril levels in future studies could verify the proposed mechanism of GFR on response to lisinopril.

PMC6815665	R01005	Red = responders to lisinopril, Green = non-responders to lisinopril.
PMC6815665	R01011	Butanoic acid was increased in responders (FC: 2.30, p = 0.041), which is a direct agonist of the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR), hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA_2 ) to induce vasodilation and inhibit atherosclerotic activity.
PMC6815665	R01012	Additionally, levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P, FC: 2.61, p = 0.032) and the precursor to S1P, sphingosine (FC: 5.20, p = 0.033), were elevated in responders compared to non-responders.
PMC6815665	R01014	Finally, elevated levels of the lipid peroxidation product, 9-oxononanoic acid (FC: 2.17, p = 0.020), may indicate increased activation of secreted phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and decreased liver de novo lipogenesis in responders.
PMC6815665	R01015	Taken together, the increased presence of metabolites involved in regulating blood pressure and vascular heath in hypertensive individuals who responded to lisinopril therapy might suggest that these subjects have the machinery in place to regulate their blood pressure whereas those who do not respond are less well positioned to do so.
PMC6815665	R01016	Responders also had relatively lower levels of 2-oxoglutarate (2-OXO, FC: 0.46, p=0.017).
PMC6815665	R02004	However, the ROC curve (, AUROC = 0.69, p = 0.03) suggests that 2-OXO may prove to be a significant biomarker predicting response to lisinopril with further validation and testing.

PMC6815665	R03000	A logistic regression analysis of clinical factors and metabolites was performed to identify a model that could be predictive of response to lisinopril in this pilot population.
PMC6815665	R03002	This model demonstrates prediction of response to lisinopril with a Pseudo R-Square 0.278 at a significance of p < 0.001.
PMC6815665	R03003	In summary, this pilot study provides preliminary evidence that suggests that increases in GFR, 2-OXO and BMI could predict poor response to lisinopril in treatment of HTN.
PMC6821861	A00001	Trimethylamine-N-Oxide (TMAO), a gut derived metabolite, has been associated with atherosclerotic burden.
PMC6821861	A00002	We determined plasma levels of TMAO by mass spectrometry and evaluated their association with PAD severity and prognosis.
PMC6821861	A00004	TMAO levels were increased in CLI compared to IC (P < 0.001).
PMC6821861	A00005	Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for severity (CLI) rendered a cutoff of 2.26 µmol/L for TMAO (62% sensitivity, 76% specificity).
PMC6821861	A00006	Patients with TMAO > 2.26 µmol/L exhibited higher risk of cardiovascular death (sub-hazard ratios ≥2, P < 0.05) that remained significant after adjustment for confounding factors.
PMC6821861	A00007	TMAO levels were associated to disease severity and CV-mortality in our cohort, suggesting an improvement of PAD prognosis with the measurement of TMAO.
PMC6821861	A00008	Overall, our results indicate that the intestinal bacterial function, together with the activity of key hepatic enzymes for TMA oxidation (FMO3) and renal function, should be considered when designing therapeutic strategies to control gut-derived metabolites in vascular patients.
PMC6821861	D00000	We determined plasma levels of TMAO to assess their association with PAD severity and their possible use as prognostic markers in symptomatic PAD.
PMC6821861	D00001	TMAO was independently associated to PAD severity and CV-mortality, but not to all-cause death and MACE.
PMC6821861	D00002	The analysis of circulating gut-microbiome derived products has identified TMAO, a secondary product after TMA is metabolized by the liver enzyme FMO3, as a possible prognostic marker in cardiometabolic diseases.
PMC6821861	D00003	In most cases increased levels of TMAO or its initial precursors, betaine, choline or L-carnitine, have been associated to atherosclerotic burden and worse outcome in arterial pathologies in large cohorts.
PMC6821861	D00004	In addition, the causal role of TMAO in atherosclerosis development has been further studied in murine models, showing accelerated plaque development with dietary supplementation of TMAO or its precursors (e.g.: choline, L-carnitine).
PMC6821861	D00005	Nonetheless, some authors found no predictive value of high TMAO levels for CV events or mortality in smaller cohorts of patients with suspected coronary artery disease or receiving dialysis, and the contribution of TMAO to early atherosclerosis development in healthy-middle-aged adults is unclear.
PMC6821861	D00007	Indeed, TMAO homeostasis considerably depends on liver FMO3 activity and renal clearance.
PMC6821861	D00008	We found increased levels of TMAO in CLI patients compared to IC, and also determined hepatic enzymes for liver function assessment, finding no differences in transaminases between IC and CLI.
PMC6821861	D00010	Moreover, other factors such as sex hormones, bile acids or insulin have been also described to regulate FMO3 activity and increase TMA oxidation.
PMC6821861	D00011	TMAO accumulation might be also related to worse kidney clearance, since it has been described that patients with decreased kidney function present elevated levels of TMAO in circulation compared to those without CKD.
PMC6821861	D00012	A trend for reduced eGFR according to TMAO quartiles was reported in the KarMeN study, while no association of TMAO with creatinine was observed in the EPIC-Heidelberg study, suggesting an irrelevant role of the kidney function for TMAO homeostasis in healthy subjects.
PMC6821861	D00013	In contrast, we found a negative correlation between TMAO and eGFR in a small cohort of people with no manifest cardiovascular disease, but with more than two cardiovascular risk factors, and older than those in the studies by Krüger et al .
PMC6821861	D00015	These data suggest that individuals with mildly impaired kidney function might be more susceptible to the detrimental effects of TMAO accumulation.
PMC6821861	D00016	In line with these observations and taking in consideration the high percentage of CKD patients in our PAD population (39%), we found a lineal-inverse association between TMAO and eGFR, and tested the possible interaction between the two according to disease severity.
PMC6821861	D00017	No interaction between TMAO and eGFR was found, however, considering the important role of the kidney on TMAO homeostasis, eGFR was included as covariate for further regression analysis.
PMC6821861	D00018	To assess the accuracy of TMAO levels for PAD patient stratification we established the association between TMAO and PAD severity after adjustment for traditional risk factors and described a cutoff value with diagnostic purposes.
PMC6821861	D00019	Increased levels of plasma TMAO have been shown to predict future major adverse cardiac events including myocardial infarction, stroke, and death in different CV pathologies and a role for gut derived metabolites in thrombosis has been described in vivo , showing that intestinal microbes can directly modulate platelet hyperresponsiveness and clot formation rate via TMAO generation.
PMC6821861	D00020	Even if most studies point towards TMAO as marker of worse outcome in CV pathologies, controversy remains when specific patient cohorts are evaluated.
PMC6821861	D00021	For example, no correlation between TMAO and increased risk for CV disease or MACE was observed in a group of end-stage renal disease patients and in subject with suspected CAD undergoing coronary angiography.
PMC6821861	D00023	In addition, TMAO has been studied mainly in coronary pathologies, while it is prognostic value in other arterial localization, such as PAD, has been little investigated.
PMC6821861	D00024	We report an association between TMAO and CV-mortality, but not with all-cause death or MACE.
PMC6821861	D00025	Our results differ in part from previous data, describing an association of TMAO levels and global death in PAD.
PMC6821861	D00028	TMAO appears to be better for CV-mortality prognosis than for all-cause death, which might be important for patient evaluation.
PMC6821861	D01002	Longer term studies should be designed to confirm the involvement of TMAO in PAD mortality.
PMC6821861	D01003	No causal relationship between high TMAO levels and CV-mortality can be inferred from our prospective study.
PMC6821861	D01005	Finally, the influence of two important variables for TMAO production, the use of antibiotics and modifications in dietary habits were not recorded and could not be included as confounding variables in our population.
PMC6821861	D01006	FMO3 activity, which has been implicated in thrombosis risk and converts TMA in TMAO, was not measured.
PMC6821861	D02000	We show increased TMAO levels according to PAD severity and an independent association between TMAO and elevated risk for CV-mortality.
PMC6821861	D02001	The design of novel therapeutic strategies towards gut-derived metabolite control in vascular patients will need to consider not only intestinal bacterial function, but also the activity of key hepatic enzymes for TMA oxidation (FMO3), and renal function.
PMC6821861	M02000	Based on a previously reported approach by Awwad H.M., et al ., a precise and reliable UHPLC-MS/MS method has been implemented in our laboratory for the quantification of TMAO in human plasma.
PMC6821861	M02001	Frozen citrate plasma samples, in which the corresponding stabilized TMA salt was formed, were utilized to perform these analyses.
PMC6821861	M03005	Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to assess disease severity (IC vs. CLI), and the cut-off value for TMAO established with the Youden Index.
PMC6821861	M03015	The additional value of TMAO for risk prediction of CV death was assessed with Harrell’s C statistics and the continuous net reclassification index (NRI) index.
PMC6821861	R00001	First we analysed the association of TMAO with well-established vascular risk factors in PAD patients.
PMC6821861	R00005	Similarly, correlations between TMAO and age (r = 0.307, p = 0.040) and eGFR (r = −0.384, p = 0.009) were also observed in a smaller group of people with no manifest CV disease (n = 45, Supplementary Table _2 ).
PMC6821861	R00009	TMAO determination showed increased levels of TMAO in CLI subjects compared to IC [median: 1.30(0.83–2.25) IC vs 2.77(1.45–7.16) µmol/L CLI,

PMC6821861	R00018	Logistic regression analysis to estimate the odds ratio (OR, 95% confidence interval) for TMAO in PAD patients (n = 262).
PMC6821861	R00023	Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to assess disease severity (IC vs. CLI) for TMAO [AUC:
PMC6821861	R00025	High TMAO levels (>2.26 µmol/L, n = 107) presented a significant association with PAD severity alone and after adjusting by other covariates (Table ).
PMC6821861	R01000	To evaluate the possible prognostic value of TMAO we recorded MACE (n = 135) and mortality, either all-cause (n = 101) or cardiovascular (n = 39) during the follow-up (4 years, min 1-max 102 months).
PMC6821861	R01002	High TMAO concentrations were associated to all-cause mortality in the unadjusted model, but not after correcting by traditional risk factors (Supplementary Table _3 ).
PMC6821861	R01003	We next determined the prognostic value of TMAO for CV-mortality.
PMC6821861	R01004	High TMAO levels rendered significant associations with all tested models (Table ).

PMC6821861	R01015	Finally, we determined proportional hazards for TMAO considering MACE (n = 135, 51%).
PMC6821861	R01016	TMAO showed no independent association with this outcome in the multivariate Cox analysis (Supplementary Table _3 ).
PMC6821861	R01017	To estimate the potential of TMAO to improve CV-death risk prediction over and beyond the basal models considered, Harrell’s C, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and continuous NRI analyses were performed.
PMC6821861	R01018	The addition of the categorical variable TMAO (>2.26 µmol/L) to the considered models including the previously mentioned relevant covariates, improved risk prediction for CV mortality in symptomatic PAD patients as assessed by NRI in models 2, 3 and 4 (Table ).
PMC6822198	D00003	Although our data are observational and we cannot draw direct causal relationships, our results suggest that PH patients have altered metabolism characterized by higher resting glycolytic activity and fatty acid oxidation, poorer glycolytic catabolism augmentation with exercise, and increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation, nucleotide metabolism, and catecholamine activation during exercise.
PMC6822198	D00008	We found that participants with ePH and PAH had higher rest fumarate and malate levels compared to controls, suggesting that at rest PH patients may exist in a higher glycolytic catabolic state.
PMC6822198	D00009	With exercise, they also do not augment their glycolytic catabolism as effectively, illustrated by lower levels of pyruvate, lactate, and succinate at peak exercise.
PMC6822198	D00011	Higher levels of acylcarnitines at rest and peak exercise may indicate that PH participants use fatty acid oxidation more than controls, or that PH participants have impaired ability to oxidize acyl-CoA species, leading to accumulations of acylcarnitine intermediates.

PMC6822198	D00040	We identified EDTA and its metabolite iminodiacetate (IDA) in both ePH and PH, which may suggest that sample collection technique and/or reagents could have contributed to batch separation, despite the fact that rigorous protocolized collection and reagent use was followed.
PMC6822198	D00045	There is variability in patient consumption of food (amount, composition, and timing) and adherence to medications (e.g. statins and antihyperglycemics), relative to when blood is drawn, and food consumption and medication adherence may differ by disease status in unknown ways.
PMC6822198	R00006	Of the 26 ePH patients included, 21 began PH specific treatment early after diagnosis: 11 began phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (5 tadalafil, 6 sildenafil); 11 began ambrisentan (8 of these were enrolled in an open-label trial of ambrisentan in ePH that has shown improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics in ePH); and 2 patients began prostacyclins.

PMC6822198	R01001	We observed elevations in glycolytic intermediates pyruvate and lactate, and TCA cycle biochemicals succinate, fumarate, and malate.
PMC6822198	R01004	This was partially due to, in PAH subjects, higher rest fumarate and malate levels, and lower peak exercise levels of pyruvate, lactate, and succinate.
PMC6822198	R02000	Fatty acid oxidation is utilized to augment glucose metabolism.
PMC6822198	R02002	Consistent with increased energy demand during exercise, free fatty acids declined (e.g. stearate (18:0)), while acylcarnitines (e.g. laurylcarnitine (C12)) accumulated in all groups, indicating higher rates of beta-oxidation during exercise.
PMC6822198	R02003	Similarly, there was elevation in diacylglycerols (e.g. palmitoleoyl-oleoyl-glycerol (16:1/18:1)), suggesting enhanced hydrolysis of lipid stores during exercise.
PMC6822198	R02004	PAH and ePH groups had higher levels of acylcarnitines at rest and peak exercise compared to controls, suggesting diseased groups may either primarily utilize beta-oxidation more at rest and exercise to augment glycolytic catabolism, or may poorly utilize downstream metabolites, leading to secondary build-up of intermediate molecules in the acylcarnitine pathway.
PMC6822198	R02005	Ketone bodies acetoacetate and 3-hydroxybutarate (BHBA), which are produced by the liver and used by peripheral tissues, such as muscle, during exercise as a fuel source, significantly decreased during exercise in control and ePH groups.
PMC6822198	R02006	Ketone bodies declined in ePH and PAH as well, but the exercise-induced difference between rest and peak exercise was less pronounced than in controls.
PMC6822198	R02007	Subsequently, acetoacetate was higher in ePH and PAH participants vs. controls at peak exercise, which can be interpreted as failure to effectively oxidize ketone bodies in diseased states.
PMC6822198	R02008	Dicarboxylic acids (e.g. suberate (C8-DC), sebacate (C10-DC)) were elevated at rest and peak exercise in ePH and PAH vs. controls.
PMC6822198	R03002	C-glycosyltryptophan and 5-(galactosylhydroxy)-L-lysine were elevated in ePH and PAH vs. controls.
PMC6822198	R03003	5-(galactosylhydroxy)-L-lysine is found almost exclusively within collagen.
PMC6822198	R03005	Collagen turnover is also associated with changes in aminosugars, which are involved in protein glycosylation reactions.
PMC6822198	R03006	Consistent with this reasoning, we found several aminosugar metabolites (e.g. N-acetylneuraminate, N-acetylglucosamine/N-acetylgalactosamine) were elevated in ePH and PAH, suggesting increased hexosamine synthesis and extracellular matrix remodeling.
PMC6822198	R03007	Dimethylarginine (SMDA + ADMA), which is derived from catabolism of proteins containing methylated arginine residues, was also elevated in ePH and PAH vs. controls at rest and peak exercise.
PMC6822198	R04000	In all groups, exercise was associated with higher levels of adenosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), hypoxanthine, and inosine.
PMC6822198	R04002	The PAH group had higher levels of several pyridine and purine nucleotides, including adenine, xanthosine, urate, and pseudouridine.
PMC6826420	A00008	Specifically, a combination profile of LysoPC 18.2, L-Proline, Hexadecanoic acid, Octadecanoic acid, Phenylalanine and LysoPC 16:1 showed close correlation for eight weight-losing samples (≥5% weight loss) and nine weight-stable samples (<5%weight loss) between predicted and actual weight change (r = 0.976, p = 0.0014).
PMC6826420	D00004	Lysolipids are very abundant in plasma and Lyso-PC 16:0 was the most abundant compound by response in this set of samples; an increase of 1.34 fold between ≥5% WL and WS patients represents a major shift in metabolic output.
PMC6826420	D00014	Previously, cachexia in patients with cancer of the oesophagus and pancreas has been linked with high levels of plasma glycerol and free fatty acids [,].
PMC6826420	D00015	Weight-losing cancer patients have been shown to have increased turnover of both glycerol and fatty acids compared with cancer patients without weight loss.
PMC6826420	D00016	Some, however, have suggested that observed increases in lipolysis and triglyceride-fatty acid cycling in cachectic patients with oesophageal cancer are due to alterations in nutritional status rather than disease presence.
PMC6826420	D00017	Cachectic ovarian cancer patients have been shown to have increased levels of free fatty acids, monoacylglycerides and diglycerides in their serum and ascitic fluid.
PMC6826420	D00019	Free fatty acids may also provide energy for the tumour, with the glycerol molecules released during the breakdown of triacylglycerides being used for gluconeogenesis by the liver [,] Previous attempts to profile metabolites associated with cachexia have yielded varying results and differences in important metabolites produced in each study.
PMC6826420	D00021	This was the first study to demonstrate a distinct metabolomics-based profile associated with the onset of muscle wasting and identify increased levels of very low and low density lipoprotein associated with aberrant glycosylation of β-Dystroglycan (β-DG, a marker of muscle wasting in this mouse model).
PMC6826420	D00023	These studies also found large numbers of glycerophospholipids and metabolites associated with amino acid metabolism and were able to identify occult sarcopenia in patients with cancer [,].
PMC6826420	D00027	The authors found a significant reduction in amino acids and glycerophospholipids associated with cachexia, a difference that has not previously been described in this condition, plus a high increase in cortisol levels.
PMC6826420	M03000	HPLC grade Acetonitrile (ACN) was purchased from Fisher Scientific (Loughborough, UK) and HPLC grade water was produced by a Direct-Q3 UltrapureWater System (Millipore, Watford, UK).

PMC6826420	M03003	Ammonium acetate was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, UK).
PMC6826420	M04000	Exactly 200 µL of the sample was mixed with 800 µL ACN containing 10 µg/mL of 2 _13 C glycine (Sigma-Aldrich) as an internal standard to ensure retention time stability, then centrifuged for 10 min before transferring into a vial with an insert.
PMC6826420	M04002	The pooled sample was prepared by pipetting 50 µL from each of the 18 samples and then mixing them together before diluting 0.2 mL of the pooled sample with 0.8 mL ACN containing 5 µg/mL of 2 _13 C glycine internal standard and centrifuging.
PMC6826420	M04003	Additionally, the prepared mixtures of authentic standard metabolites containing 10 µg/mL of 2 _13 C glycine as internal standard were run.
PMC6826420	M05001	The column was eluted with a mobile phase consisting of 20 mM ammonium carbonate in HPLC-grade water (solvent A) and ACN (solvent B), at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min.

PMC6839420	A00009	The models identified important biomarkers: lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), stearic acid (C18:0), lignoceric acid (C24:0), palmitic acid (C16:0) and heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) among saturated fatty acids, Cis-10-pentadecanoic acid (C15:1), Cis-11-eicosenoic acid (C20:1n9), and erucic acid (C22:1n9) among monounsaturated fatty acids and the Gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3n6) polyunsaturated fatty acid.
PMC6839420	D00003	We found that AD patients had increased levels of C14:1, C15:1, C16:1n7, C20:1n9, C22:1n9, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, and total omega-6/ total omega-3 ratio while they had lower levels of total omega-3 fatty acids, C12:0, C17:0, C18:0 in a statistically significant manner.
PMC6839420	D00004	However, Bonferroni correction indicated that only the levels of C22:6n3, total omega 3, C18:3n6, C15:1, C20:1n9, C12:0, C15:0, C17:0, C18:0 and total omega 6/ total omega 3 ratio were statistically significantly different.
PMC6839420	D00008	Among the statistically significant correlations, lauric acid (C12:0), pentadecanoic acid (C15:0), stearic acid (C18:0), myristoleic acid (C14:1), cis-10 pentadecanoic acid (C15:1) and arachidonic acid (C20:4n6) were stronger correlated in the case than the control group (p < 0.001).
PMC6839420	D00018	For the 78.9% predictive accuracy of the second model, myristic acid (C14:0), lignoceric acid (C24:0), Cis-10 pentadecanoic acid (C15:1), gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3n6), exercise and alcohol consumption were identified as the most sensitive markers.
PMC6839420	D00021	More importantly, it has been shown that regular moderate exercise can increase glucose uptake and reduce insulin resistance (DeFronzo et al., ).
PMC6839420	D00022	The role of alcohol consumption in health and its effects on the immune system have been extensively discussed, and although several studies show that moderate alcohol consumption may be beneficial to health (Carlé et al., ) others demonstrate that it has a detrimental effect on the gut microbiome and immunotolerance (Wang et al., ; Sarkar et al., ; National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, ).
PMC6839420	D00023	ANN analysis showed that the most important predictors for the ADs were the following: Cis-11-eicosenoic (C20:1n9), lauric acid (C12:0), Erucic (C22:1n9), Cis-10 pentadecanoic acid (C15:1), stearic acid (C18:0), myristic acid (C14:0), heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), palmitic acid (C16:0) in the order of importance.
PMC6839420	D00026	In the group of SFAs lauric acid (C12:0), myristic acid (C14:0), stearic acid (C18:0), lignoceric acid (C24:0), palmitic acid (C16:0) and heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) can be potent biomarkers.
PMC6839420	D00027	SFAs including stearic acid (C18:0), myristic acid (C14:0) and palmitic acid (C16:0) are endogenously converted to the MUFAs oleic acid (C18:1n9cis), myristoleic acid (C14:1) and palmitoleic acid (C16:1n7), respectively.
PMC6839420	D00029	Indeed insulin resistance has been linked to impaired desaturase activity and high levels of stearic and palmitic acid (Mayneris-Perxachs et al., ).
PMC6839420	D00030	Lignoceric (C24:0) is a very long chain fatty acid along with behenic acid (C22:0) and arachidic acid (C20:0).
PMC6839420	D00031	These are major components of ceramides that have been shown to have a protective role against insulin resistance and diabetes (Lemaitre et al., ).
PMC6839420	D00032	Heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) belongs to the odd-chain fatty acids, and although it has been widely used as a biomarker of dairy intake (Yakoob et al., ), there is recent evidence that it is related to metabolic diseases and gut microbiome imbalance (Jenkins et al., ).
PMC6839420	D00039	In the case of MUFAs, Cis-10-pentadecanoic acid (C15:1), Cis-11-eicosenoic acid (C20:1n9) and erucic acid (C22:1n9) were demonstrated as potent biomarkers by our predictive model.
PMC6839420	D00040	Cis-11-eicosenoic acid (C20:1n9) originates from oleic acid (C18:1n9cis) and can be elongated to produce erucic acid (C22:1n9) (
PMC6839420	D00043	Erucic acid intake (through canola, Wallflower, or Lorenzo's oil) has been suggested to be beneficial for peroxisomal disorders like X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy by reducing the saturated VLCFA by negative feedback (Risé et al., ).
PMC6839420	D00044	Gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3n6), the intermediate metabolite of linoleic acid (C18:2n6) conversion to dihomo-gama-linoleic acid (C20:3n6) and Arachidonic acid (C20:4n6) was also a sensitive marker for the predictive model.
PMC6839420	D00045	Dihomo-gama-linoleic acid (C20:3n6) and Arachidonic acid (C20:4n6) are the main precursors of the pro-inflammatory mediators.
PMC6839420	D00046	There have been several studies showing that arachidonic acid, along with other omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids can be valuable markers in chronic inflammatory diseases because they reflect the inflammation status and the dietary preferences of the individual (Patterson et al., ;
PMC6839420	D00050	Fatty acids were associated with islet autoimmunity and primary insulin autoimmunity (higher palmitoleic acid, cis-vaccenic, arachidonic, docosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids decreased risk; higher α-linoleic acid and arachidonic: docosahexaenoic and omega-6/omega-3 acid ratios increased risk).
PMC6839420	M02000	Methyl non-adecanoate (74208, Honeywell Fluka™; Honeywell, Seelze, Germany) was used as an internal standard.
PMC6839420	M02001	The calibration of the standard mixture was performed with a mixture of FA methyl esters (47885-U; Supelco-Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
PMC6839420	M02002	All other solvents used were of the highest purity available [methanol, n-hexane (both from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), HCl (301721] and 2,6-i-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (BHT, B1378l) (both from Sigma-Aldrich).
PMC6839420	M03005	The standard internal mixture (200 μl methyl non-adecanoate in hexane containing BHT) was added to the 100 μl plasma.
PMC6839420	M03006	The FAs were hydrolyzed and derivatized into methyl esters by the addition of 5% v/v methanolic HCl.
PMC6839420	M03008	The extraction of FA methyl esters was performed using hexane, and they were transferred to GC injection vials with a crimp cap.
PMC6839420	M04002	The FA methyl esters were separated using an HP-5 ms capillary column (30 m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm).
PMC6839420	R01001	Values of mean ± SD and median for each TFA, total omega-3, total omega-6, total Monounsaturated FA (MUFA), total Polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), total Saturated FA (SFA) for the two groups are listed in .
PMC6839420	R01004	From the ratios included only total omega-6/total omega-3 was significantly different between the groups (p < 0.001).
PMC6839420	R01005	C22:6n3, total omega 3, C18:3n6, C15:1, C20:1n9, C12:0, C15:0, C17:0, C18:0 and total omega 6/ total omega 3 ratio were statistically significantly different between the two groups after Bonferroni correction.
PMC6839420	R01010	Lauric acid (C12:0), pentadecanoic acid (C15:0), stearic acid (C18:0), myristoleic acid (C14:1), cis-10 pentadecanoic acid (C15:1) and arachidonic acid (C20:4n6) showed the strongest metabolite-metabolite correlations among the TFAs in the case group, while age was not correlated to any of these metabolites in any group.
PMC6839420	R03002	Alcohol abstinence, myristic acid (C14:0), and lignocericc acid (C:24:0) were positively correlated to the absence of an AD.
PMC6839420	R03003	Negative correlations with the absence of ADs were found in lack of exercise, cis-10 pentadecanoic acid (C15:1) and gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3n6).

PMC6839420	R04009	The most important biomarkers which contribute to the model were Cis-11-Eicosenoic (C20:1n9), Lauric acid (C12:0), Erucic acid (C22:1n9), Cis-10-pentadecanoic acid (C15:1), Stearic acid (C18:0), Myristic acid (C14:0), Heptadecanoic acid (C17:0), Palmitic acid (C16:0).
PMC6875299	A00005	All the differential metabolites were listed, and proline and xanthosine were the two of the most downregulated metabolites by plasma treatment.
PMC6875299	A00006	By comprehensive metabolic pathway analysis with the KEGG pathway, we showed that alanine, aspartate, glutamate, and purine metabolism pathways were the most significantly suppressed after gas plasma treatment in human endothelial cells.
PMC6875299	D00011	Among them, proline and xanthosine were the two of the most downregulated metabolites by plasma treatment.
PMC6875299	D00012	Proline could be oxidized by plasma treatment into three oxidation products corresponding to (Pro-2H + O)H+ at m/z 130.05, (Pro + O)H+ at m/z 132.07, and (Pro + 2O)H+ at m/z 148.06 by mass spectrum as reported by Takai et al..
PMC6875299	D00013	Xanthosine is a nucleoside derived from xanthine and ribose.
PMC6875299	D00014	Although there is no report about xanthosine could be directly affected by plasma, there were several studies reported that plasma could induce oxidative stress and damage DNA [, ].
PMC6875299	D00017	By analyzing the metabolic pathways with KEGG analysis that have the highest correlation with differential metabolites, we reported that alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism had significant change after plasma jet treatment.
PMC6875299	D00018	In the glucose-alanine cycle pathway, glutamate dehydrogenase in muscle catalyzes the binding of α -ketoglutaric acid to ammonia to form glutamate, followed by glutamate catalyzed by alanine aminotransferase; pyruvic acid forms alpha-ketoglutarate and alanine.
PMC6875299	D00019	In the bioactive substance metabolism pathway, glutamate itself is an excitatory neurotransmitter, which is widely present in the brain and spinal cord.
PMC6875299	D00020	γ -Aminobutyric acid formed by decarboxylation of glutamate is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in organisms widely present in the body [, ].
PMC6875299	D00021	However, in the amino acid synthesis pathway, glutamic acid is an important precursor for the synthesis of glutamine, proline, arginine, and lysine [, ].
PMC6875299	D00022	Cold plasma treatment could suppress glutamate metabolism, which might benefit for diseases that have a high level of glutamate metabolism [, ].
PMC6875299	D00023	In addition, plasma jet treatment can also significantly reduce the purine metabolic pathway in endothelial cells.
PMC6875299	D00024	Purine is a substance in the human body that could cause gout when its metabolism is disordered.
PMC6875299	D00025	After a series of metabolic changes, the resulting product of purine is called uric acid.
PMC6875299	D00026	Uric acid does not have any physiological function in the human body.
PMC6875299	D00027	Under normal circumstances, 2/3 of uric acid produced in the body is excreted by the kidneys and 1/3 is excreted by the large intestine.
PMC6875299	D00028	The body's uric acid is constantly being produced and excreted, so it maintains a certain concentration in the blood.
PMC6875299	D00029	When the concentration of blood uric acid is too high, uric acid is deposited in the joints, soft tissues, cartilage, and kidneys in the form of sodium salts and causes joint swelling, deformity, stiffness, ecchymosis around the joints, nodules, and gouty kidney stones [, ].
PMC6875299	D00031	Based on our results, plasma treatment could inhibit the purine metabolism and thus lowers the level of uric acid, which might be benefit for gout-related diseases.
PMC6875299	D00035	In this case, long-term treatment with low concentration of several long-lived species by plasma might be suppressed and would be benefit to those diseases that have abnormal high level of glutamate and purine metabolism.
PMC6875299	D00036	Even more, we might inject the plasma-treated saline solution into the vessels to regulate the abnormal glutamate and purine metabolism.
PMC6875299	D00039	Furthermore, we found two differential metabolic pathways, glutamate metabolism and purine metabolism pathway, which was vulnerable to plasma treatment, and was significantly suppressed by plasma treatment.
PMC6875299	D00040	Our results indicated that low-dose long-term plasma treatment might benefit those diseases that have abnormal high level of glutamate and purine metabolism.
PMC6875299	M02001	HMEC-1 cells were cultured in the Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 50 μ g/mL streptomycin (Gibco-Invitrogen, CA).
PMC6875299	M03000	Pyridine and chloroform were purchased from Admas (Shanghai, China).
PMC6875299	M03001	Bistrifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and 1% trimethyl chloro silane (TMCS, v/v) were from REGIS Technologies Inc (Morton Grove, IL, USA) and methanol (HPLC grade) from CNW Technologies (Shanghai, China).
PMC6875299	M03002	L -2-Chlorophenylalanine was from Hengbai Biotechnology Co Ltd (Shanghai, China).
PMC6875299	M06000	All samples were transferred into a 2 mL tube, and 1000 μ L precold extraction mixture (methanol/chloroform (v : v) = 3 : 1) with 10 μ L internal standard (L -2-chlorophenylalanine, 1 mg/mL stock) was added.
PMC6875299	M06003	After evaporation in a vacuum concentrator, 20 μ L of methoxyamination hydrochloride (20 mg/mL in pyridine) was added and then incubated at 80°C for 30 min and then derivatized by 30 μ L of the BSTFA regent (1% TMCS, v/v) at 70°C for 1.5 h.
PMC6875299	R04005	Among them, proline and xanthosine were the two of the most downregulated metabolites by plasma treatment.
PMC6875299	R07010	From the bubble diagram, we could find out that alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathway was the most significantly suppressed after gas plasma treatment in HMEC-1 human endothelial cells.
PMC6875299	R07011	Furthermore, it was worth noting that purine metabolism was also significantly inhibited in endothelial cells.
PMC6885816	A00006	Urinary analyte changes were as follows: impaired metabolic health—increased N_ε -carboxymethyl-lysine, glucosepane, glutamic semialdehyde, and pyrraline; impaired vascular health—increased glucosepane; and impaired renal health—increased BCAAs and decreased N_ε -(γ -glutamyl)lysine.
PMC6885816	A00008	In 2-step analysis, algorithms combining subject age, BMI, and urinary N_ε -fructosyl-lysine and valine discriminated between healthy controls and impaired health (any type), accuracy of 78%, and then between types of health impairment with accuracy of 69%-78% (cf.
PMC6885816	D00001	The levels found suggested that for amino acid crosslinks, glucosepane had the highest urinary excretion, and for oxidized amino acids, GSA had the high urinary excretion.
PMC6885816	D00003	This study also revealed the potential diagnostic utility of urinary BCAAs and FL.
PMC6885816	D00004	Positive likelihood ratios suggested that the use of urinary excretion of BCAA and FL as features in diagnostic algorithms gave small, moderate, and conclusive evidence of increased likelihood of early-stage cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal disease, respectively.
PMC6885816	D00008	In the current method, urine ultrafiltrate is mixed with stable isotopic standards in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid which stabilizes analytes from risk of degradation at neutral and high pH; all are stable at low pH and ambient temperature.
PMC6885816	D00010	For these reasons, we chose urine analysis as a preferred sample analysis protocol for health screening related to markers of protein glycation, oxidation, and nitration—although in machine learning analysis, only FL and BCAAs were informative features for subject group classification.
PMC6885816	D00011	We defined impaired metabolic health herein by reference to detection of impaired glucose tolerance by increased A1C and to insulin resistance represented by the HOMA-IR.
PMC6885816	D00012	This is associated with exposure to increased glucose concentrations as judged by continuous glucose monitoring studies.
PMC6885816	D00013	It was surprising that urinary excretion of glucose-derived FL was not increased in impaired metabolic health, cf .
PMC6885816	D00015	This may be due to efficient repair of FL free adduct by fructosamine 3-phosphokinase at levels formed in prediabetes and a relatively large and variable contribution from food which may have increased data dispersion and thereby precluding detection of differences between study groups.
PMC6885816	D00016	Increased glucose exposure was rather reflected in increased urinary excretion of the glucose-dependent glycation-derived crosslink, glucosepane.
PMC6885816	D00017	Glucosepane is formed from the degradation of FL and is not repaired enzymatically, potentially providing greater sensitivity for detection of dysglycemia.
PMC6885816	D00018	In analysis of protein glycation and oxidation adducts in plasma protein in a prospective study, we recently found that levels of glucosepane were the best predictor of development of T2DM.
PMC6885816	D00019	Increased urinary excretion of GSA and CML—formed oxidatively from FL—in early-stage impaired metabolic health may be indicative of oxidative stress.
PMC6885816	D00020	There was also increased urinary excretion of pyrraline which may indicate increased food consumption in this study group.
PMC6885816	D00021	The positive correlations of CML and GSA with pyrraline suggest that urinary increases of these metabolites were linked to increased food consumption.
PMC6885816	D00024	Vascular health impairment was associated with increased urinary excretion of glucosepane.
PMC6885816	D00025	Both glucosepane and CIMT correlated positively with age.
PMC6885816	D00026	Glucosepane is a major protein crosslink and may impact negatively on vascular contractility and function.
PMC6885816	D00032	In the machine learning-based analysis, we found that combinations of age, BMI with FL, and val, leu, or total BCAA was able to discriminate between healthy controls and subjects with early-stage metabolic, vascular, or renal health decline.
PMC6885816	D00035	Declining renal health, referenced to increased serum creatinine and decreased eGFR, is a measure of increased risk of renal disease linked to premature mortality and progression to renal failure.
PMC6885816	D00037	In subjects with impaired metabolic health, BMI correlated positively with urinary excretion of MG-H1, which is maintained when normalised to pyrraline, i.e., corrected for dietary AGE intake.
PMC6885816	D00038	MG-H1 is the major AGE formed from the reactive dicarbonyl metabolite, methylglyoxal.
PMC6885816	D00040	The failure of urinary excretion of CML and MG-H1 to emerge as diagnostic features for diagnosis of early decline in metabolic and vascular health may be due to a large and variable contribution to urinary excretion of these analytes from digested food, compared to increases of endogenous formation.
PMC6885816	D00044	There is profound limited awareness of early-stage CKD with only 9% of people with stage 3 CKD aware of their health impairment—screening for CKD by serum creatinine and deduced estimated GFR (eGFR) is considered not cost effective other than for patients with T2DM and thereby increased risk of CKD.
PMC6885816	D00046	An alternative noninvasive measure of insulin resistance is the _13 C-glucose test which requires ingestion of a stable isotopically labelled _13 C-glucose drink and collection of breath samples over the subsequent 6 h for measurement of exhaled [_13 C]/[_12 C]CO_2 ratio.
PMC6885816	D00048	An alternative noninvasive method for detection of impaired glucose tolerance is measurement of skin autofluorescence but this is compared poorly, with DOR of 2.7, cf.
PMC6885816	D00050	Alternative biomarkers for increased CIMT as an indicator of impaired vascular health are red cell distribution width and serum podocalyxin with DOR values of 3.9 and 3.2, respectively [, ].
PMC6885816	D00052	An alternative noninvasive biomarker of impaired renal health is salivary creatinine for which the DOR value for the same classification of CKD as applied herein was 17.8, cf .
PMC6885816	D00057	For this, further studies of sample stability during storage and shipment at ambient temperature for urinary analytes of N_ε -fructosyl-lysine (FL) and BCAAs would be required.
PMC6885816	D00059	For analyte quantitation, sample throughput may be increased with FL, BCAAs, and creatinine analysed in one run by stable isotopic dilution analysis LC-MS/MS or alternatively by _1 H nuclear magnetic resonance.

PMC6885816	M05005	GEEK was detected in a separate chromatography run to resolve it from isobaric glu-lys and lys-glu dipeptides.
PMC6885816	M05009	LC-MS/MS was performed as described previously [, ] with chromatography using two Hypercarb™ (5 μ m particle size, 0.2 × 50 mm and 0.2 × 250 mm) columns, column switching, and elution with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and custom acetonitrile (MeCN) gradient.
PMC6885816	M05010	Different chromatography conditions were used for assay of GEEK: the column was Hypercarb™ (2 μ m particle size, 0.2 × 150 mm) with isocratic elution at 0.2 ml/min with 3.75% MeCN and 0.1% TFA in water (solvent A) for 15 min.

PMC6885816	M05014	GSA was prepared from N-acetyl-L-ornithine using lysyl oxidase activity from eggshell membrane by modification of the method of Akagawa et al..
PMC6885816	M05017	N_α -Acetyl-L-ornithine (43.6 mg, 0.25 mmol) was incubated with ESM (2.5 g) in 25 ml sodium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 9.0, 37°C) for 7 days with shaking.

PMC6885816	R00002	All health impairment study groups had increased plasma total cholesterol with respect to healthy controls, with increased LDL cholesterol in impaired metabolic and vascular health and decreased HDL cholesterol and increased triglycerides and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in impaired vascular and renal health.
PMC6885816	R00004	Changes in plasma LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were not always accompanied by similar changes in plasma ApoB and ApoA1, respectively.
PMC6885816	R01004	With respect to healthy controls, changes found were as follows: impaired metabolic health—increased urinary excretion of CML, glucosepane, pyrraline, and GSA; impaired vascular health—increased glucosepane; and impaired renal health—increased BCAAs and decreased GEEK.
PMC6885816	R01009	FL correlated positively with MG-H1 (r = 0.84) and 3-NT (r = 0.62), and MG-H1 correlated positively with 3-NT (r = 0.72).
PMC6885816	R01011	There were also positive correlations of pyrraline with FL, CML, and MG-H1 (r = 0.43), suggesting significant contributions to urinary fluxes of these analytes from food—. In subjects with impaired metabolic health, surprisingly, there were no correlations of A1C or HOMA-IR with urinary glycation adducts.
PMC6885816	R01012	There were negative correlations of all BCAAs with A1C (r = −0.38 to −0.39) and positive correlations of BCAAs with eGFR (r = 0.38–0.50), GSA (r = 0.57–0.61), and GEEK (r = 0.45–0.54).
PMC6885816	R01013	There were positive correlations of pyrraline with CML, MG-H1, GSA, and GEEK (r = 0.44–66), suggesting these analytes had significant contributions from food—. In subjects with impaired vascular health, there were positive correlations of CIMT, A1C, and glucosepane with age (r = 0.86, r = 0.51, and r = 0.37, respectively) and negative correlation of eGFR with age (r = −0.51).
PMC6885816	R01014	Subjects with impaired vascular health, therefore, have age-related increase in CIMT thickness along with age-related early-stage decline in glucose tolerance and renal function and increased glucose-mediated protein crosslinking.
PMC6885816	R01015	There were positive correlations of pyrraline with CML (r = 0.57), MG-H1 (r = 0.42), GSA (r = 0.49), and DT (r = 0.39), suggesting these analytes had significant contributions from food—. In subjects with impaired renal health, there were positive correlations of CIMT (r = 0.79) and glucosepane with age (r = 0.46), suggesting that subjects with impaired renal function have increased CIMT and increased glucose-mediated protein crosslinking with age.
PMC6885816	R01016	There were positive correlations of pyrraline with CML (r = 0.50) and MG-H1 (r = 0.55), suggesting again these AGE free adducts had significant contributions from food—.
PMC6885816	R02002	Features included in algorithm training were as follows: age, gender, BMI, alcohol intake, smoking status (current, former smoker, and never smoked), and urinary metabolites—FL, CML, MG-H1, GSP, pentosidine, pyrraline, DT, GSA, 3-NT, GEEK, and leu, ile, and val or total BCAA.
PMC6885816	R02006	We found three combinations of features, Sets 1 – 3, which gave similar diagnostic performance: Set 1 features—age, BMI, and urinary excretion of FL and valine; Set 2 features—age, BMI, and urinary excretion of leu; and Set 3 features—age, BMI, and urinary excretion of val.
PMC6885816	R02013	In step 1, outcome of the algorithm computations indicated that again few features were required for this: age, BMI, and urinary excretion of FL and valine.
PMC6930386	A02001	Regardless of whether traditional clinical plasma lipid levels were normal or abnormal, we observed a significant reduction in the levels of five lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) species (LPC18:2, LPC18:1, LPC20:2, LPC20:1, and LPC20:0) in the obese group compared with the normal-weight group (difference = −31.29% to −13.19%; P =9.91 × 10_−5  to 2.28 × 10_−2 ).
PMC6930386	A02002	The ability of these five LPC species to discriminate adolescent obesity was confirmed in the PLS-DA model.
PMC6930386	A03000	The findings provided evidence for the association of some LPC species with adolescent obesity.
PMC6930386	A03001	The discriminatory effects of five LPC species were identified between normal-weight and obese adolescents, independent of traditional clinical plasma lipid levels.
PMC6930386	D00003	In the present study, we observed significantly decreased concentrations of unsaturated LPC, LPC18:2, LPC18:1, LPC20:2, LPC20:1, and LPC20:0 in obese adolescents, which were not affected by traditional clinical plasma lipid levels.
PMC6930386	D00004	A possible discriminatory effect of the five LPC species was identified between normal-weight and obese adolescents and was independent of traditional plasma lipid indicators.
PMC6930386	D00007	Significantly decreased levels of LPC18:1 and LPC18:2 have been observed in obese children.
PMC6930386	D00009	Although the lipid data from adults and children are difficult to compare, consistent changes in the levels of some LPC species related to obesity have been identified [–].
PMC6930386	D00010	A large population-based cohort study showed a strong negative correlation between the total LPC levels and BMI, although the authors did not further explore the LPC species.
PMC6930386	D00011	Rauschert et al. reported negative correlations between LPC18:1 and LPC18:2 with waist circumference that were independent of the LDL-C and HDL-C levels.
PMC6930386	D00012	Wang et al. also observed lower concentrations of unsaturated LPC, LPC18:1, and LPC18:2 in overweight/obese adults than in nonobese adults.
PMC6930386	D00013	Heimerl et al. detected significant negative correlations between BMI and the levels of unsaturated LPC, LPC15:0, LPC18:1, LPC18:2, LPC18:3, LPC20:0, and LPC22:6.
PMC6930386	D00014	Tulipani et al. concluded that plasma concentrations of LPC17:0, LPC18:1, and LPC18:2 show inverse correlations with BMI, body weight, and waist and hip circumference in morbidly obese subjects [, ].
PMC6930386	D00015	Notably, decreased plasma concentrations of LPC18:1 and LPC18:2 have been detected in both subjects with metabolically unhealthy obesity and metabolically healthy obesity.
PMC6930386	D00016	In addition, lower total LPC, LPC18:0, LPC18:2, and LPC20:4 levels were measured in obese and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes than in nonobese adults.
PMC6930386	D00017	A difference in the LPC profile was not observed between obese individuals and obese subjects with type 2 diabetes.
PMC6930386	D00018	Moreover, Wallace et al. reported associations between the levels of several LPC species, BMI, and inflammatory markers.
PMC6930386	D00019	Additionally, LPC levels were significantly negatively correlated with the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), indicating that LPC may exert anti-inflammatory effects [, ].
PMC6930386	D00020	The levels of some LPC species appear to be altered, although the direction of changes is not consistent.
PMC6930386	D00022	The authors identified higher levels of LPC14:0 and LPC18:0 and a lower concentration of LPC18:1 in obese subjects compared with lean subjects.
PMC6930386	D00024	Based on this pattern, a higher LPC 16:1 level was detected in the obese group, while higher levels of other LPC species were observed in nonobese subjects.
PMC6930386	D00025	The present study extended the results from previous studies by revealing significant reductions in the levels of the unsaturated LPC subclass and five LPC species (LPC18:2, LPC18:1, LPC20:2, LPC20:1, and LPC20:0) in obese adolescents that were independent of changes in traditional clinical plasma lipid levels.
PMC6930386	D00027	The mechanism underlying the reduction remains unknown but may be attributed to the decreased activity of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT).
PMC6930386	D00029	LCAT removes fatty acids from the sn-1 or -2 position of PC to form LPC.
PMC6930386	D00030	Thus, decreased activity of LCAT in obese subjects potentially leads to a decrease in circulating LPC levels [, ].
PMC6930386	D00033	The proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of LPC are contradictory and poorly understood but may be due to acyl chain-dependent differences in biological activity.
PMC6930386	D00041	In this study, the association between the levels of five LPC species and obesity was not explained by the association between traditional plasma lipid levels and obesity.
PMC6930386	D00042	Therefore, these LPC species may be early and specific indicators of obesity, independent of the traditional plasma lipids levels.
PMC6930386	D00044	Some studies also discovered that LPCs exert beneficial effects on glucose metabolism.
PMC6930386	D00045	LPCs stimulate glucose uptake in adipocytes, potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and lower blood glucose levels in rat models of diabetes [, ].
PMC6930386	D00046	Thus, the reduction in circulating levels of LPC associated with obesity may contribute to the imbalance in glucose metabolism in obese individuals.
PMC6930386	D00048	The value of this study lies in the adoption of a systematic lipidomic approach to investigate the association of plasma levels of LPC species with adolescent obesity.
PMC6930386	M01001	TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C levels were measured in the blood samples with a biochemical auto-analyser (Hitachi 7060, Tokyo, Japan).
PMC6930386	M01002	Traditional abnormal clinical plasma lipid levels were defined in this study as abnormal levels of at least 2 of the 4 lipids: TG ≥1.10 mmol/L; TC ≥4.403 mmol/
PMC6930386	M01005	These cutoff values were chosen based on the cholesterol levels in children and adolescents developed by the expert panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP).

PMC6930386	R02001	In the groups with traditional normal clinical plasma lipid levels, significantly lower levels of five lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC18:1, LPC18:2, LPC20:2, LPC20:1, and LPC20:0) were observed in the obese group than in the normal-weight group (difference = −16.32% to −31.29%; P =9.91 × 10_−5  to 6.67 × 10_−3 ).
PMC6930386	R02003	Markedly lower levels of five LPC species were observed in obese individuals than in normal-weight individuals (difference = −22.27% to −13.19%; P =4.40 × 10_−3  to 2.28 × 10_−2 ).
PMC6930386	R02004	Inverse correlations between LPC18:1, LPC18:2, LPC20:2, LPC20:1, and LPC20:0 and obesity were identified in groups with different traditional clinical plasma lipid levels.
PMC6930386	R02005	The observed reduction in the levels of the five LPC species in obese children was still significant after normalization to the total concentration of glycerophospholipids (i.e., PC, LPC, PE, PI, PG, PS, LPE, LPI, PC (O), PC (P), PE (O), and PE (P)).
PMC6930386	R02007	Additionally, in the obese group, an elevated phosphatidylcholine 32:0 (PC32:0) level (difference = 20.87%; P =4.40 × 10_−3 ) was observed in adolescents with traditional abnormal clinical plasma lipid levels and decreased PC32:0 levels (difference = −16.32%; P =4.91 × 10_−4 ) were observed in adolescents with traditional normal clinical plasma lipid levels in our study.
PMC6930386	R02011	Abbreviations: NN, normal weight with traditional normal clinical plasma lipid levels; NA, normal weight with traditional abnormal clinical plasma lipid levels; ON, obese with traditional normal clinical plasma lipid levels; OA, obese with traditional abnormal clinical plasma lipid levels; LPC/PC x: y , (lyso) phosphatidylcholines with acyl chain length x and y double bonds.
PMC6930386	R03001	Five lipid species (LPC18:2, LPC18:1, LPC20:2, LPC20:1, and LPC20:0) met this criterion, as shown in .

PMC6930386	R04000	The results of correlation analyses between these discriminatory LPC lipids and traditional clinical parameters or anthropometric parameter (BMI) are shown in .
PMC6930386	R04001	Negative correlations of these discriminatory LPC lipids with BMI were observed.
PMC6930386	R04002	The levels of LPC18:2, LPC18:1, and LPC20:1 were positively correlated with the HDL-C levels.
PMC6930386	R04003	LPC18:2 level was positively correlated with TG level.
PMC6930386	R04004	LPC18:1 level was negatively correlated with TC level.
PMC6930386	R04005	Generally, obese people present elevated levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C and decreased levels of HDL-C. However, the correlations between the levels of the five LPC lipids and traditional plasma lipid indicators were not directionally consistent.
PMC6930386	R04006	Based on these results, the associations between the levels of the five LPC species and obesity were not explained by the association between traditional plasma lipid levels and obesity.

PMC6934557	M01001	First, proteins were removed using acetonitrile (AcN) (1:8 sample/AcN) and agitating for 2 min, followed by centrifugation at 15200 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C.
PMC6934557	M01003	Dry residues were reconstituted in AcN/water [50:50] with 0.1% formic acid followed by agitation for 1 min.

PMC6934557	R00000	AcN was used for extraction in this study, because deproteinization with an OS is a critical step in untargeted metabolomics to avoid ion suppression, and more information about lipid species is obtained in comparison to methanol, the other widely used solvent.
PMC6934557	R00003	Total ion chromatograms (TIC) of HC and CRC samples (Fig. ) revealed a clear separation among: medium-polar metabolites (e.g., phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and steroids), eluted between minutes 6 and 14; very polar metabolites (e.g., some amino acids and sugars), eluted in the first 5 minutes and best separated using a HILIC column; and non-polar metabolites, eluted between minutes 14 and 17.
PMC6934557	R00006	There is a clear separation among: medium-polar metabolites, such as phospholipids, endocannabinoids, or steroids (6–14 min); very polar metabolites, including some amino acids or sugars (1–5 min); and non-polar metabolites.

PMC6934557	R02005	The RT and fragmentation pattern were virtually identical between marker and standard in the cases of sphinganine (Fig. ) and PC (18:1) (Fig.
PMC6934557	R02008	A slight difference in RT was observed between DEA and the corresponding standard but the fragmentation patterns were similar, suggesting that this metabolite could belong to the endocannabinoid family (Fig.

PMC6934557	R02018	Fragment interpretation revealed characteristic ions of phosphatidylcholines, such as m/z 104 and 184.
PMC6934557	R04000	The transformation of a normal cell into a tumor cell mediates through diverse metabolic pathways (e.g., glycolysis, Krebs cycle, urea cycle, osmoregulation, eicosanoid biosynthesis, lipid metabolism, etc.).
PMC6934557	R04002	In this study, CRC samples revealed alterations in lipid species involved in endocannabinoid, sphingolipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolisms.
PMC6934557	R04003	Endocannabinoids are known to have many different functionalities in the gastrointestinal tract, specifically in the colon, and they have been reported to inhibit CRC cell proliferation, mainly via CB1 receptors.
PMC6934557	R04004	In the present study, endocannabinoid levels were lower in CRC samples than in HC samples, which may be explained by the overexpression in CRC of lipid metabolizing enzyme MAGL, a key enzyme in endocannabinoid metabolism.
PMC6934557	R04006	Significant alterations were also observed in two sphingolipids: sphinganine and a neutral glycosphingolipid.
PMC6934557	R04007	Both are N-acylated by ceramide synthases (CerS) and have shown increased concentrations in CRC.
PMC6934557	R04008	It has been reported that human CRC cell apoptosis is promoted by CerS inhibition or the application of ceramide analogues.
PMC6934557	R04009	We therefore hypothesized that decreased sphinganine concentrations might be explained by increased CerS concentrations.
PMC6934557	R04010	Because neutral glycosphingolipids are produced from sphingoid bases, their concentrations are also decreased in CRC.
PMC6934557	R04011	Sphingolipids, key components of biologic membranes, are involved in numerous processes related to tumor progression and have been found to inhibit the growth of cancer cells and induce their apoptosis.
PMC6934557	R04012	Specifically, sphinganine was reported to induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells by arresting the cell cycle at G2/M phase.
PMC6934557	R04014	A downregulation of the aforementioned pathways would result from low concentrations of these sphingolipids, favoring metastasization.
PMC6934557	R04015	The interplay between ceramides and endocannabinoids also appears to be crucial for cancer progression, given that cannabinoids regulate sphingolipid metabolic pathways by promoting sphingomyelin depletion and markedly increasing ceramide concentrations.
PMC6934557	R04016	Finally, dysregulated choline metabolism has been associated with oncogenesis and tumor progression.
PMC6934557	R04017	Various enzymes are involved in this alteration of choline pathways, including glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterases (GDPDs).
PMC6934557	R04018	These enzymes cleave glycerophosphocholine (GPC) to form glycerol-3-phosphate and choline, and their overexpression has been described in cancer, driving tumor cell migration and metastasis.
PMC6934557	R04019	In addition, the silencing of GDPDs was found to increase GPC and PE concentrations.
PMC6934557	R04020	Accordingly, increased levels of GDPDs in metastatic CRC would be associated with decreased levels of GPC and PE.
PMC6934557	R04021	Significantly altered GPC and PE species have previously been described in CRC.
PMC6934557	R04022	We highlight that none of the markers identified in this study have previously been related to CRC with the exception of LPC (18:1).
PMC6934557	R04023	Interestingly, a significant decrease in LPC (18:1) was observed in non-advanced CRC patients but an increase in our patients with metastatic CRC, suggesting that this metabolite may potentially be useful as a biomarker of the progression of this disease.
PMC7047385	A00000	Phenylketonuria (PKU; OMIM#261600) is a rare metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene resulting in high phenylalanine (Phe) in blood and brain.
PMC7047385	A00002	There is a controversial discussion of whether patients with PKU have an additional risk for atherosclerosis due to interference of Phe with cholesterol synthesis and LDL-cholesterol regulation.
PMC7047385	A00003	Since cholesterol also plays a role in membrane structure and myelination, better insight into the clinical significance of the impact of Phe on lipoprotein metabolism is desirable.
PMC7047385	A01000	Concurrent plasma Phe in PKU patients showed a wide range with a mean of 899 μmol/L (50–1318 μmol/L).
PMC7047385	A01001	Total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were significantly lower in PKU patients versus controls: 179.4 versus 200.9 mg/dL (p  < 0.02) and 79.5 versus 104.1 mg/dL (p  < 0.0038), respectively.
PMC7047385	A01002	PKU patients also had lower levels of 22 LDL subclasses with the greatest differences in LDL2 Apo-B, LDL2 Particle Number, LDL2-phospholipids, and LDL2-cholesterol (p  < 0.0001).
PMC7047385	A01003	There was a slight negative correlation of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol with concurrent Phe level.
PMC7047385	A01004	VLDL5-free cholesterol, VLDL5-cholesterol, VLDL5-phospholipids, and VLDL4-free cholesterol showed a significant (p  < 0.05) negative correlation with concurrent Phe level.
PMC7047385	A01006	Tyrosine, glutamine, and creatinine were significantly lower in PKU patients compared to controls, while citric and glutamic acids were significantly higher.
PMC7047385	A02000	Using NMR spectroscopy, a unique lipoprotein profile in PKU patients can be demonstrated which mimics a non-atherogenic profile as seen in patients treated by statins.
PMC7047385	A03000	Adult PKU, Treatment, Cholesterol, Lipoprotein subclasses, NMR
PMC7047385	D00000	The data show an impact of Phe on lipoprotein concentration in plasma indicating a negative influence on cholesterol synthesis or LDL regulation.
PMC7047385	D00001	Animal models have demonstrated decreases in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and mevalonate-5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase in liver and brain by high Phe leading to impaired cholesterol synthesis.
PMC7047385	D00004	In summary, there have been inconsistent findings about the impact of Phe on cholesterol concentration: 12 studies demonstrated lower levels of cholesterol, while 6 studies did not, as recently published in a systematic review by Montoya Parra et al..
PMC7047385	D00006	Significant disparities are limited to cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and LDL subclasses.
PMC7047385	D00007	Interpretation of the intergroup difference is difficult since there is only a small negative correlation of Phe on total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, which is not statistically significant (data not shown).
PMC7047385	D00008	In contrast, there is a significant negative correlation between plasma Phe and higher densities of VLDL subfractions (VLDL5 corresponding to 1.006 kg/L) as shown in Fig.
PMC7047385	D00010	Low cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol have also been observed by Couce et al.
PMC7047385	D00013	While HDL-cholesterol can be lowered by a vegan diet, LDL-cholesterol levels are not influenced by a vegan diet.
PMC7047385	D00014	However, in a meta-analysis, it is evident that cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol are reduced by a vegan diet.
PMC7047385	D00015	Our patients with a less well-controlled diet leading to higher Phe levels should have higher intakes of natural protein and therefore higher risks of elevated lipoproteins.
PMC7047385	D00016	As shown by the extensive lipoprotein subclass analysis, they had lower total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol but not HDL-cholesterol.
PMC7047385	D00017	This leads to the discussion of how cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol may be influenced/decreased in PKU patients.
PMC7047385	D00018	Regulation of LDL-cholesterol is a complex mechanism as demonstrated in a comprehensive review by Goldstein and Brown.
PMC7047385	D00019	Cells obtain cholesterol from endogenous synthesis via HMG CoA, receptor-mediated uptake, and lysosomal hydrolysis of LDL-cholesterol.
PMC7047385	D00020	Statins reduce cholesterol synthesis by inhibition of HMG-reductase activity.
PMC7047385	D00021	High Phe may mimic this statin effect.
PMC7047385	D00023	When entering the nucleus, SREBPs also activate endogenous cholesterol biosynthesis.
PMC7047385	D00024	A low cholesterol diet as present in PKU patients may lead to activation of SREBPs which activate LDL receptor transcription and HMGR activity, thereby increasing cholesterol synthesis and decreasing LDL.
PMC7047385	D00027	No data are available demonstrating whether high Phe interferes with this protein function.
PMC7047385	D00029	The statin-like effect of high Phe may also be the cause of higher concentrations of citrate and glutamic acid in patients compared to controls, as inhibition of HMGR leads to an increase of HMG-CoA which feeds acetyl CoA into the citric cycle.
PMC7047385	D00031	However, a negative impact of Phe on cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol (except HDL-cholesterol) and their subclasses indicate a key role of elevated Phe on the lipoprotein profile with great similarities to that seen in patients with high cholesterol using statins.
PMC7047385	D00033	However, acetoacetic and 3-OH-butyric acid tended to be somewhat higher but reached no significant differences (Table ).
PMC7047385	D00034	The same was true for lactic acid, which showed (due to measuring plasma) higher levels for both controls and patients than found in capillary blood.
PMC7047385	D00035	Glutamine was significantly lower in PKU patients as previously described and may be due to increased excretion of N-acetylglutamine in urine (due to high phenylacetic acid and glutamine excretion in urine).
PMC7047385	D00038	Although quality of treatment in our patients was highly variable, most of them used amino acid supplements, which are devoid of Phe but enriched in tyrosine and other essential amino acids.
PMC7047385	D00039	Despite this supplementation, tyrosine was significantly lower in PKU patients which may contribute to neurotransmitter depletion and impaired brain protein synthesis [, , , ].
PMC7047385	D00041	This may be due to the number of relatively well-treated patients in our sample (11 of 22 had Phe levels < 900 μmol/L, a value below the recommended target Phe level for German adult PKU patients.
PMC7047385	D00042	Furthermore, six patients had Phe levels < 600 μmol/L, a target value recommended in the European guidelines for PKU [, ]).
PMC7047385	D00044	In our patients, there was a significant difference in creatinine.
PMC7047385	D00045	The low creatinine levels may be due to lower muscle mass.
PMC7047385	D01003	Besides imbalances in the lipoprotein pattern revealing lower levels of cholesterol and LDL subclasses, together with low molecular weight analysis, this method allows a more comprehensive monitoring of PKU patients as also demonstrated in another (urinary) metabolomics approach recently.
PMC7047385	D01004	Our findings of low LDL-cholesterol and low LDL subclass levels in these patients suggest this may protect them from early atherosclerosis and the lipoprotein profile is non-atherogenic.
PMC7047385	D01005	Since cardiovascular comorbidities have been described by our group and others [, ], it cannot be excluded that patients may suffer from other risk factors such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, or increased oxidative stress caused by high Phe or the Phe-restricted low protein diet.
PMC7047385	D01006	In addition, a possible direct effect of Phe on the arterial wall leading to arterial stiffness was shown recently [, ].
PMC7047385	D01007	The mechanism of decreased cholesterol and LDL lipoprotein subclasses by increased Phe needs further investigation.
PMC7047385	M00006	Two out of 22 patients with triglycerides of 475 and 625 mg/dL respectively were excluded from lipoprotein evaluation.
PMC7047385	M00007	The high triglycerides were assumed not to be related to PKU or BMI (27.5 and 23.6 kg/m_2 , respectively).
PMC7047385	M00009	All patients were told to follow a Phe-restricted diet, but adherence to treatment recommendations was highly variable, yielding plasma Phe levels between 50 and 1318 μmol/L (mean 899).
PMC7047385	M00014	Patient characteristics BMI body mass index, GPV genetic predicted value, Phe plasma phenylalanine at time of investigation.
PMC7047385	R00000	There were significantly lower levels of total and LDL-cholesterol in PKU patients versus controls: 179.4 versus 200.9 mg/dL
PMC7047385	R00002	Total triglycerides differed widely among patients, but there was no difference between patients and controls (Complete list of results in Table S2).
PMC7047385	R00003	Significant disparities were restricted to LDL subclasses (Table ) with the greatest differences in LDL2 Apo-B, LDL2 Particle Number, LDL2-phospholipids, and LDL2-cholesterol (p  < 0.05).
PMC7047385	R00006	Adherence to diet did not correlate with lipoproteins but did with blood Phe levels: a significant negative correlation of plasma Phe with VLD5-cholesterol, VLDL5-free cholesterol, VLDL5-phospholipid, and VLDL5-triglyceride is shown in Fig.
PMC7047385	R00008	Partial correlation of plasma Phe corrected for the effect of BMI with VLDL5-free cholesterol (R = -0.49.1, p  = 0.024), VLDL5-triglycerides (R = -0.55,
PMC7047385	R00009	p  = 0.009), VLDL5-cholesterol (R = -0.54,
PMC7047385	R00010	p  = 0.012), and VLDL5- phospholipids (R = -0.58, p  = 0.006) confirmed the negative impact of Phe on these VLDL subclasses.
PMC7047385	R00011	Cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol also showed a negative correlation to Phe; however, this was not statistically significant.
PMC7047385	R00013	Explanation of terminology is presented in Table S1 Correlation of plasma phenylalanine with (a) VLDL5-free cholesterol (R = -0.5.1,
PMC7047385	R00014	p < 0.02); (b) VLDL5-triglycerides (R = -0.45, p  < 0.04); (c) VLDL5-cholesterol (R = -0.49,
PMC7047385	R00015	p  < 0.02); and (d) VLDL5-phospholipids (R = -0.49, p  < 0.04).
PMC7047385	R01000	Low molecular weight metabolites besides Phe revealed significant differences for the following metabolites (PKU versus controls, Table ): glutamine (611 versus 690 μmol/L, p  < 0.01); creatinine (74.8 versus 86.1 μmol/L, p < 0.01); and tyrosine (42.5 versus 56.9 μmol/L, p  < 0.005).
PMC7047385	R01001	Glutamic acid as well as citric acid were significantly higher in PKU patients versus controls: 87.6 versus 50.5 μmol/L (p  < 0.015) and 186.9 versus 157.2 μmol/L (
PMC7047385	R01004	Significant differences were set to p  < 0.05 (t-test) BMI did not show a significant influence on the lipoprotein subclasses in the patients investigated except quality of dietary treatment; patients with higher BMI had less optimal Phe control than those with a lower BMI (Fig. ).
PMC7047385	R01005	Phenylalanine control at time of investigation grouped by body mass index (BMI) ≥25 (n  = 10) and < 25 (n  = 12) in PKU patients versus controls (n  = 14)
PMC7058291	A00006	Blood plasma of subjects belonging to the low disease prevalence cluster exhibited lowered levels of the GlycA inflammation marker, very low-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, valine and leucine compared to controls.
PMC7058291	D00005	Indeed, our metabolomic results revealed reduced levels of both VLDL and triglycerides in the individuals belonging to the low-prevalence cluster, and this may reflect differences in APOA5 genotype compared with controls.
PMC7058291	D00007	Enhanced Lpl activity reportedly leads to better clearance of circulating triglycerides, which may translate to a lower risks of developing diabetes, dyslipidemia and/or hypertension.
PMC7058291	D00008	MLXIPL encodes a transcription factor that activates glucose-dependent conversion of excess nutrients into triglycerides instead of glycogen.
PMC7058291	D00009	LIMA1 may modulate plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by regulating intestinal cholesterol absorption.
PMC7058291	D00015	Fatty acids derived from triglycerides and VLDL can induce inflammation.
PMC7058291	D00016	We found that GlycA signal intensity appears to be associated with the APOA5 genotype, suggesting that the inflammatory response may be linked to lipid metabolism.
PMC7058291	D00017	Reduced levels of triglycerides and VLDL could be detected easily in the NMR spectra of the low-disease-prevalence group and may explain the reduced inflammation status observed for those individuals.
PMC7058291	D00018	In terms of small molecules, the branched chain amino acid leucine is particularly intriguing: free leucine in the circulation promotes glucose uptake by hepatic cells via myostatin, which in turn inhibits glycogenesis and promotes the synthesis of triglycerides and VLDL.
PMC7058291	D00019	Furthermore, leucine acts as a mTORC1 activator, and in hepatic cells mTORC1 inhibits the CREBH-ApoA5 axis, which leads to blunted ApoA5 production.
PMC7058291	D00020	Thus, a low concentration of leucine in the blood may have a dual effect in the liver—it reduces the production of VLDL/triglycerides yet enhances ApoA5 synthesis and assists in the clearance of VLDL/triglycerides from the circulation.
PMC7058291	D00021	Leucine also activates mTORC1 in the immune system, which in turn regulates Hif1a levels in T cells and monocytes, and Hif1a is indispensable for T cell activation.
PMC7058291	D00023	For humans, leucine is an essential amino acid that is acquired mainly from ingested food; moreover, because leucine is a hydrophobic amino acid, it is most abundant in relatively high-fat foods.
PMC7058291	D00024	We hypothesize that individuals belonging to the low prevalence cluster for diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension generally do not experience the “double jeopardy” of elevated postprandial levels of circulating fatty acids and leucine, which may synergistically activate different inflammation pathways and thereby increase disease susceptibility.
PMC7058291	D00035	For example, healthy subjects belonging to Cluster 1 who later develop diabetes may have a prominent oxidative stress component as alluded to by the inverse association with serum albumin and bilirubin, both of which are well-established circulatory antioxidants [, ].
PMC7058291	R00003	The mean values of most traits fell within the normal range, with the exception of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (121 mg/dL), which was higher than the level recommended by the National Cholesterol Education Program of the United States (< 100 mg/dL).
PMC7058291	R01005	The biplot vectors representing the risk-factor traits associated with the three diseases (e.g. blood triglyceride concentration for dyslipidemia; fasting blood glucose for diabetes; systolic blood pressure for hypertension) point toward the same general direction.
PMC7058291	R01006	Only high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) content was inversely associated with the three diseases, which is consistent with its proposed role as a protective factor.
PMC7058291	R01019	eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate; PLATELET: platelet count; HBA1C: serum glycated hemoglobin concentration; WHR: waist-to-hip ratio; BMI: body mass index; WBC: white blood cell count; FBG: serum fasting blood glucose concentration; SYS.BP: systolic blood pressure; TG: serum triglyceride concentration; γGT: serum γ-glutamyltransferase concentration; SGPT: serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase concentration; URATE: serum uric acid concentration; LDL: serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration; mALB: urine microalbumin concentration; RBC: red blood cell count; HCT: hematocrit; AFP: serum α-fetoprotein concentration; ALB: serum albumin concentration; BUN: blood urea nitrogen concentration; T_BIL: serum total bilirubin concentration; HDL: serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration.
PMC7058291	R01023	The main factors differentiating these two clusters are total serum bilirubin (T_BIL) and albumin (ALB), each of which has been associated with diabetes and hypertension as a protective factor in other populations [, ].
PMC7058291	R01026	In addition to the known risk factors for diabetes, dyslipidemia and hypertension, subjects in Cluster 4 were also positively associated with the levels of γ-glutamyltransferase (γ GT), serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (SGPT, also called alanine aminotransferase, ALT) and uric acid (URATE) as well as white blood cell count (WBC).
PMC7058291	R02004	These results, combined with the observed higher blood triglyceride levels, suggest that impaired lipid metabolism is a trait that is shared by diseased subjects in Clusters 2 and 4.
PMC7058291	R04003	We first examined the far methyl region of the spectra, which contains signals from lipoproteins and triglycerides.
PMC7058291	R04004	Compared with the control subjects, Cluster 2 subjects had lower concentrations of very-low-density/low-density lipoprotein (VLDL/LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides, consistent with our phenotypic observations.
PMC7058291	R04005	We also observed a decrease in the concentrations of the branched-chain amino acid leucine, which has resonances located in this same region.
PMC7058291	R04006	Moving the observation window downfield, we observed a reduction of the GlycA signal at ~2.04 ppm, which is a composite marker of systemic inflammation.
PMC7058291	R04008	(B) Downfield region from (A) which includes the GlycA inflammation marker and acetone.
PMC7058291	R04013	Based on the FDR plots, lipoprotein and triglyceride signals appeared to increase with the number of C alleles.
PMC7058291	R04014	We also noted concurrent changes in the signals of leucine and GlycA.
PMC7073856	A00006	Untargeted metabolomics analysis of serum samples identified 22 metabolites, including amino acids, lipids, and tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates.
PMC7073856	D00008	Training-induced changes in serum metabolites lack consensus, but have been reported to include decreases in hippuric acid, lactate, pyruvate, and hypoxanthine, and increases in creatinine, dimethylamine, 3-methylxanthine, TCA cycle intermediates, and phospholipids.
PMC7073856	M05003	Extraction of the metabolites was performed as follows: 600 µL of methanol-d4 was added to 200 µL of sample, followed by stirring for 5 min, an ultrasonic bath for 5 min, and centrifugation at 13,000 RPM for 10 min.
PMC7073856	R00010	A total of 22 metabolites (amino acids, fatty acids, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) intermediates) were identified using 1H NMR spectroscopy (see for the chemical shifts and peak areas).
PMC7074047	A00007	We identified a set of nine metabolites, namely: nicotinamide, hypoxanthine, xanthine, and 1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline with decreased concentrations and N-acetyl-L-Leucine, arginine, RAC-glycerol 1-myristate, 1-oleoyl-RAC-glycerol, cystathionine with increased concentrations in POAG; the modification of nicotinamide, N-acetyl-L-Leucine, and arginine concentrations being the most discriminant.
PMC7074047	D00004	Nicotinamide deficiency was the most important feature, supported by its identification by the four data analyses performed in this study.
PMC7074047	D00006	Indeed, a study of the mouse DBA/2J model with high intra-ocular pressure has recently established the proof of concept of vitamin B3 therapeutic interest to prevent glaucoma.
PMC7074047	D00007	Our current investigations in humans together with the recent report in mice, argues in favor of a mitochondrial-related nicotinamide deficiency, contributing to the age-related vulnerability of the optic nerve in glaucoma pathogenesis.
PMC7074047	D00008	This statement is further reinforced by the fact that mitochondrial complex I deficiency was also reported in lymphoblasts from glaucoma patients, a fact that could be related to the decrease level of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (reduced form) (NADH) in these cells.
PMC7074047	D00009	The increased concentration of N-acetyl-L-Leucine is the second most important discriminating feature, evidenced by univariate analysis, OPLS-DA analysis, and the Biosigner algorithm.
PMC7074047	D00011	Only one patient in our glaucoma cohort used Tanganil and none in the control cohort, thus excluding an effect related to a systemic medication with N-acetyl-L-Leucine.
PMC7074047	D00013	The increased arginine concentration in POAG plasma was evidenced by three of the four data methods and was already reported in the targeted metabolomics study, together with that of methionine and tyrosine, which were also identified here by the univariate analysis, thus attesting the reproducibility of the results obtained with two different mass spectrometry approaches.
PMC7074047	D00014	Modification of arginine concentration may be related to the altered arginine/nitric oxide regulatory pathway that characterize glaucoma.
PMC7074047	D00015	The 1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, also known as salsolinol, a endogenous derivate of dopamine, was decreased in POAG patients.
PMC7074047	D00016	Its activity inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, which would explain the increased concentration of tyrosine in the glaucoma signature.
PMC7074047	D00017	Hypoxanthine and xanthine concentrations are also reduced in POAG signature.
PMC7074047	D00018	Interestingly, we found similar decreased concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine in the plasma of patients with Dominant Optic Atrophy related to OPA1 mutations.
PMC7074047	D00020	Further, two monoacylglycerides, i.e., RAC-glycerol-1-myristate, also known as monomyristin, and 1-oleoyl-RAC-glycerol, also known as monolein, were significantly increased here, but without clear rationale yet to be established.
PMC7074047	D00021	Cystathionine, also modified in the POAG signature, is metabolically tightly connected to methionine and cysteine through sulfur, thiols, and folate metabolisms, which were already incriminated in glaucoma [,].
PMC7074047	D00022	The POAG signature also disclosed alterations of the monosaccharides’ metabolism, with galactose and arabinose displaying increased concentrations in patients vs. controls.
PMC7074047	D00024	The increased concentration of glyceraldehyde, an intermediate of glycolysis also argues in favor of carbohydrate metabolism perturbations, paralleling previous results reporting alterations of galactose, fructose, and mannose metabolisms in the plasma of POAG patients.
PMC7074047	D00027	However, in order to validate the nicotinamide deficiency, we previously measured the level of this vitamin using a targeted LC-MS/MS method specifically designed for the quantification of nicotinamide.
PMC7074047	D00029	Nicotinamide deficiency observed during the present non-targeted LC-HRMS metabolomics investigation was confirmed by targeted LC-MS/MS in both the initial cohort and the replication cohort, thus strengthening the results obtained in the present study.
PMC7074047	M00001	Methanol (MeOH), water (H_2 O), and formic acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Illkirch, France).
PMC7074047	M00002	Isotope labeled endogenous metabolite standards (at a minimal purity of 98%), namely 17α-Hydroxyprogesterone-d8 (2,2, 4,6,6,21,21,21-d8), L-Thyroxine-13C6, Succinic acid-2,2,3,3-d4, Pyruvic acid-1-13C, and DL-Alanine-15N were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Quentin Fallavier, France).
PMC7074047	M00003	A working solution at a concentration of 10 μg/mL of each isotope labeled standards was prepared in MeOH.
PMC7074047	M02000	The study cohorts were composed of 34 POAG and 30 age- and sex-matched control individuals whose recruitment criteria and clinical features were recently described in a study focused on a quantitative dosage of nicotinamide.
PMC7074047	M03000	Blood samples from each participant were collected in heparin tubes at least three hours after the last meal.
PMC7074047	M03005	Briefly, plasma samples were allowed to thaw on ice and sample deproteinization was achieved using ice-cold methanol (−20 °C).
PMC7074047	M03006	Two hundred and sixty microliter of cold MeOH was added to 30 μL plasma and fortified with 10 μL of isotope labeled endogenous metabolite solution (10 μg/mL of each).
PMC7074047	M03009	The dry extract was reconstituted with 200 μL of a solution of 2% aqueous MeOH (initial conditions of the chromatographic elution gradient).
PMC7074047	R00006	Univariate analysis highlighted 28 metabolites with FDR (false discovery rate) below 5%, among which six exhibiting a FC (fold change) greater than 1.5, i.e., nicotinamide, N-acetyl-L-leucine, hypoxanthine, cystathionine, 1-oleoyl-rac-glycerol, and 1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline.
PMC7074047	R00014	This panel of metabolites included nicotinamide, N-acetyl-L-leucine, hypoxanthine, 1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline, 1-oleoyl-rac-glycerol, arginine, xanthine, and rac-glycerol 1-myristate, the latter three belonging to the metabolite panel highlighted by univariate analysis, but with a fold change of 1.3, hence, lower than 1.5.
PMC7074047	R00024	The restricted Biosigner algorithm suggested two ‘S’ tier metabolites, i.e., nicotinamide and N-acetyl-L-Leucine from PLS-DA and Support Vector Machines (SVM) analysis, respectively.
PMC7074047	R00029	The algorithm assessed the relevance of the 160 metabolites identified for the prediction performances of Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier models and subsequently identified 2 robust ‘S tier’ features, i.e., nicotinamide and N-acetyl L-leucine.
PMC7074047	R00030	The accuracies of the PLS-DA and SVM models on the final S signature were respectively 73.7% and 71.1% for nicotinamide and N-acetyl L-leucine.
PMC7074047	R00036	Plotting the frequency of each feature in the predictive model enabled the identification of three groups of variables: I—features selected in at least 250 models (six variables: uracil, arginine, N-acetyl-putrescine, nicotinamide, cortisone, and 5,6-dihydrouracil); II—features selected in less than 250 but in more than 100 models (13 variables), and III—features selected in less than 100 out of the 303 best predictive models (141 variables) (Supplemental Figure S5).
PMC7074047	R00041	Among the group I variables identified following LASSO, uracil, N-acetyl-putrescine, and cortisone have a VIP value less than 1.3, whilst 5,6-dihydrouracil has a non-significant q -value (q = 0.0986).
PMC7074047	R00042	Accordingly, we kept only nicotinamide and arginine as the main features for the LASSO model.
PMC7074047	R00045	In this respect, the POAG signature includes nine significant metabolites: nicotinamide, N-acetyl-L- leucine, arginine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, Rac-glycerol 1-myristate, 1-oleoyl-rac-glycerol, cystathionine, and 1-methyl-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline.
PMC7074047	R00049	In this respect, as detailed elsewhere, we proceeded to a blind independent external validation of nicotinamide, the metabolite identified by all four statistical approaches.
PMC7074047	R00050	Nicotinamide dosage using an independent quantitative method was performed on plasma samples from both the initial cohorts including 64 individuals reported in the current investigation, and replicative cohorts of 35 individuals.
PMC7074047	R00051	Nicotinamide quantification confirmed the observation made from the non-targeted metabolomics analysis reported here.
PMC7074478	A00000	Go to: Evidence gained from recent studies has generated increasing interest in the role of vitamin D in extraskeletal functions such as inflammation and immunoregulation.
PMC7074478	A00001	Although vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), evidence as to whether vitamin D supplementation may cure or prevent chronic disease is inconsistent.
PMC7074478	A00002	Since 25OH-vitamin D (25OHD) has been suggested to be an acute-phase protein, its utility as a vitamin D status marker is therefore questionable.
PMC7074478	A00003	In this study, possible interactions of vitamin D and inflammation were studied in 188 patients with IBD, with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels ≥ 5 mg/dL and/or fecal calprotectin ≥ 250 µg/g defined as biochemical evidence of inflammatory activity.
PMC7074478	A00004	Levels of 25OHD and vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP) were determined by ELISA, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25OHD) and dihydroxycholecalciferol (24,25OHD) by LC-MS/MS.
PMC7074478	A00005	Free and bioavailable vitamin D levels were calculated with the validated formula of Bikle.
PMC7074478	A00006	Serum 1,25OH2D and vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) levels were shown to differ between the inflammatory and noninflammatory groups: patients with inflammatory disease activity had significantly higher serum concentrations of 1,25OH2D (35.0 (16.4–67.3) vs. 18.5 (1.2–51.0) pg/mL, p < 0.001) and VDBP (351.2 (252.2–530.6) vs. 330.8 (183.5–560.3) mg/dL, p < 0.05) than patients without active inflammation.
PMC7074478	A00008	(−0.155, p = 0.049) while concentrations of serum 1,25OH2D correlated positively with hsCRP (0.157, p = 0.036).
PMC7074478	A00011	Serum total 25OHD concentration was the only vitamin D parameter found to have no specific correlation with any of the inflammatory markers.
PMC7074478	A00012	According to these results, the traditional parameter, total 25OHD, still appears to be the best marker of vitamin D status in patients with inflammatory bowel disease regardless of the presence of inflammation.
PMC7074478	A01000	Vitamin D, vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D metabolites, biomarker, chronic inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease
PMC7074478	D00000	Due to its higher concentration in blood, relatively longer half-life and better stability compared to other vitamin D metabolites [,,], circulating levels of 25OHD represent the most commonly utilized parameter for the assessment of vitamin D status.
PMC7074478	D00001	Therefore, clinical definitions and recommendations for vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency are based on total 25OHD levels.
PMC7074478	D00002	Consequently, the majority of epidemiologic studies focusing on vitamin D in relation to human health outcomes have used total 25OHD concentrations as a marker.
PMC7074478	D00003	However, 25OHD is less active than some other forms of vitamin D and has to be converted to 1,25OH2D by CYP27B1 (25-hydroxyvitamin D(3)-1alpha-hydroxylase) to achieve its full biologic potency [,].
PMC7074478	D00004	Similar to steroid hormones, the mechanism of action of active 1,25OH2D is mediated through binding to VDR, which regulates genomic (and to some degree nongenomic) intracellular actions of vitamin D [,].
PMC7074478	D00006	Therefore, 1,25OH2D can be synthesized locally in a tissue-specific fashion [,,].
PMC7074478	D00007	Furthermore, on the basis of recent research, it may be postulated that other vitamin D metabolites and analytes may be useful adjunctive parameters for a more thorough characterization of individual vitamin D status; for example, 24,25OH2D, which might be used to assess catabolism of 25OHD and 1,25OH2D
PMC7074478	D00009	Thus, the question arises as to which one of these metabolites, or which combination of metabolites, provides a better representation of vitamin D status in the setting of which physiological/pathophysiological condition.
PMC7074478	D00010	Additionally, accumulating evidence that 25OHD, the traditional marker of vitamin D status, is an acute-phase reactant [,,,] poses the additional question of whether this is also the case in the setting of chronic inflammation: Can 25OHD be regarded as a reliable biomarker of vitamin D status in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions?
PMC7074478	D00011	Regarding the use of 1,25OH2D and 24,25OH2D as markers of vitamin D status, our results identified a significant inverse correlation between 1,25OH2D and hsCRP, and a significant positive correlation between 24,25OH2D and ESR.
PMC7074478	D00012	Although the correlation was not strong, the fact that it was significant suggests that these two parameters may be related to—and/or influenced by— inflammation, thus calling into question their accuracy as markers of true vitamin D status in patients with inflammatory disorders.
PMC7074478	D00013	Additionally, given its tight regulation by parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium and phosphate, its relatively short half-life, and its ability to be synthesized locally, the added benefit of measuring 1,25OH2D remains uncertain [,].
PMC7074478	D00014	An even stronger correlation with PTH has been observed for 24,25OH2D. However, it might be useful as an indicator of tissue-level 1,25OH2D activity [,].
PMC7074478	D00015	While both parameters could be used to gain a better insight into individual vitamin D status, neither 1,25OH2D nor 24,25OH2D seems to be a better sole marker of vitamin D status than 25OHD.
PMC7074478	D00019	When the patients from the present study were classified according to serum total 25OHD levels, the proportion of vitamin D-deficient and -insufficient patients with active inflammation was increased compared with the group of patients with normal vitamin D levels.
PMC7074478	D00023	Our results suggest that 25OHD currently seems to be the most reliable marker of vitamin D status, even in patients with chronic inflammatory disorders such as IBD.
PMC7074478	D00025	Analogous to steroid and thyroid hormones, vitamin D and its hydroxylated metabolites circulate in the blood by binding to a transport protein.
PMC7074478	D00026	The majority of circulating 25OHD is tightly bound to VDBP (85–90%), an α-globulin synthesized by the liver, kidneys and certain other tissues.
PMC7074478	D00028	The sum of albumin-bound and free 25OHD is termed “bioavailable vitamin D”, while the sum of free, albumin-bound and VDPB-bound vitamin D fractions is known as “total vitamin D”.
PMC7074478	D00029	All clinical definitions and recommendations for vitamin D sufficiency are based on total 25OHD [,,].
PMC7074478	D00032	We therefore considered whether this applies in the presence of chronic inflammation and addressed the question of whether total concentrations of these metabolites, or free levels, can most accurately determine vitamin D status in this case.
PMC7074478	D00035	Coming back to the focus of this study, it can be concluded that neither free nor bioavailable 25OHD seems to be an optimal sole marker of vitamin D status in patients with chronic inflammatory disease.
PMC7074478	D00039	In addition, possible effects of potent IBD medications were not evaluated in detail: In both the inflammatory and non-inflammatory groups, approximately 70% of patients were currently receiving treatment with corticosteroids, immunomodulators (e.g., azathioprine, methotrexate) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors, which are known and intended to reduce chronic inflammation and the bioclinical parameters thereof, and may also affect vitamin D metabolism.
PMC7074478	D00042	Additionally, since PTH, calcium or phosphate levels were not determined, that might have provided valuable additional information in the interpretation of the findings, the question of whether 25OHD acts like an acute phase reactant in IBD remains open.
PMC7074478	D00045	However, to the best of our knowledge, this study in patients with IBD is the very first to investigate the best marker of vitamin D status in patients with chronic inflammatory disease, and an important first step to further, deeper exploration.
PMC7074478	D00046	On the basis of our results, we suggest that direct quantification of free vitamin D metabolites might be a promising area for future research.
PMC7074478	M01004	Also excluded were patients who had used vitamin D or calcium supplements in the previous six months.
PMC7074478	M02002	Serum total 25OHD concentrations were measured by direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the IDK 25OHD immunoassay kit (Immundiagnostik, Bensheim, Germany) and expressed in ng/mL. Vitamin D status of the participants was classified according to the recommendations of the Endocrine Society, with sufficiency defined as 30–100 ng/mL, insufficiency as 21–29 ng/mL and deficiency as < 20 ng/mL. Measurement of circulating serum VDBP concentration was carried out with ELISA using the IDK human vitamin D binding protein immunoassay kit (Immundiagnostik, Bensheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PMC7074478	R01002	Serum 1,25OH2D and VDBP levels were shown to differ between the inflammatory and noninflammatory groups: patients with inflammatory disease activity had significantly higher serum concentrations of 1,25OH2D (35.0 (16.4–67.3) vs. 18.5 (1.2–51.0), p < 0.001) and VDBP (351.2 (252.2–530.6) vs. 330.8 (183.5–560.3), p < 0.05) than patients without active inflammation.
